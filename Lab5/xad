A Foreign Policy 100 top global thinkers plug for the QDDR
For a tiny bit of good news in such a bleak week, you and President Clinton came in at no. 13 in
Foreign Policy's second annual list of top global thinkers, with special commendation to you for
launching the QDDR (and for cookstoves and women's rights, as well as for your strong position
on American leadership). Michele Flournoy and I also tied for no. 74 on the basis of our respective
roles in the QDR and other reviews at DoD and the QDDR here at State. Here are the write ups
13. Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton
for proving that you don't need to be president to act presidential.
FORMER PRESIDENT I NEW YORK
SECRETARY OF STATE I WASHINGTON
Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in September, Hillary Rodham Clinton sounded a confident note:
""After years of war and uncertainty, people are wondering what the future holds, at home and abroad. So let me say
it clearly: The United States can, must, and will lead in this new century.""
Ironically, two of the people most crucial to the new global century are the Clintons themselves: the ex-president and
the ex-would-be-president, the power couple now defined by their position just outside the highest reaches of power.
Except that, these days, both Clintons are more influential, and more beloved, than ever. Bill's Clinton Global
Initiative is starting to feel like a sexier, more effective competitor not just to Davos but to the United Nations itself,
bringing world leaders together to commit their resources to fighting poverty with market-based, technocratic
solutions. As of this summer, his foundation had contributed $23 million and countless man-hours to the effort to
rebuild Haiti. Polls have shown he's a better advocate for Democratic candidates than the actual president, and he
spent most of the fall stumping for woebegone Dems from Orlando to Seattle.
Meanwhile, Hillary showed up in one recent poll as the most popular political figure in the United States, an
accolade she has earned through a no-drama approach to an array of thankless tasks: brushing off Vladimir Putin's
temper tantrum to reach agreement on nuclear disarmament and Iran sanctions, promoting women's rights over the
objections of entrenched traditionalists, and launching an innovative effort to bring clean cookstoves to the world's
poorest. But what she has mainly stood for is American competence, with her Quadrennial Diplomacy and
Development Review a major, if unglamorous step toward making U.S. statesmanship a more agile beast. If this is
what Clinton nostalgia looks like, bring it on.
74. Michele Flournoy and Anne-Marie Slaughter
for setting the tone of how the United States engages with the world.
POLICY PLANNING CHIEFS, DEFENSE AND STATE DEPARTMENTS I WASHINGTON
Barack Obama campaigned in 2008 on the promise of changing not just the style but the substance of how the
United States deals with its allies and enemies abroad, and the job of figuring out how to enact the changes fell
largely to two people in particular. At the State Department, Anne-Marie Slaughter, director of policy planning, is
spearheading the department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. The review aims to rejuvenate
marginalized civilian agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development, preparing for a world in
which America's worst threats are not great-power rivals but the upheavals associated with failed and failing states.
Slaughter's Pentagon counterpart is Undersecretary for Policy Michele Flournoy, co-founder of the Center for a New
American Security think tank, who articulated a vision for a new Democratic realism in foreign policy that both
candidates Hillary Clinton and Obama embraced in the 2008 election. In 2010 she oversaw the Pentagon's own
quadrennial review, a blueprint that cuts back on big-ticket weapons systems and focuses instead on the immediate
needs posed by today's asymmetrical conflicts. Flournoy has also been a vocal advocate for Obama's Afghanistan
strategy, albeit a pragmatic one: ""I don't want to suggest that achieving success will be simple or easy,"" she told
the Senate in February. ""We need to prepare for the possibility that things may get harder before they get better.""

The Cable: Granger seeking chairmanship of State and foreign
ops subcommittee
Granger seeking chairmanship of State and foreign ops subcommittee
Posted: 03 NOV 2010 1131 AM PDT
Texas Congresswoman Kay Granger will seek the chairmanship of the State and Foreign Operations
Appropriations Subcommittee, according to her spokesman, ending rumors that she would forgo the post in favor of
some other position.
Although no decisions have been made, until last night Granger was the ranking Republican on the panel and she is
the clear frontrunner for the job. She would succeed current chairwoman Nita Lowey(D-NY), who has served as
chairwoman since 2006.
""Congresswoman Granger is interested in continuing on as chair of the state and foreign operations appropriations
subcommittee,"" Matt LeffingwelL her press secretary, toldThe Cable Wednesday.
When power switches in Congress, a complicated game of musical chairs begins as senior members jockey for
committee and subcommittee chairs. Just being the highest-ranking minority member on a panel doesn't mean one
automatically takes over the chairmanship.
But if Granger does succeed Lowey, she will play a large role in writing the bills that appropriate money for State
Department operations, USAID, foreign operations, foreign assistance, humanitarian assistance, and many other
things. Those accounts all face unprecedented pressure next year as the GOP led Congress will be looking for
spending cuts that don't have strong domestic constituencies.
Last month, we identified Granger as one of 10 Republicans who stand to be influential in the next Congress if
the GOP won control of the House. Since then, we've received several e-mails from sources who had heard that
Granger would forgo the subcommittee chairmanship to pursue leadership of another panel.
We've heard that Ander Crenshaw (R-FL), the third-ranking Republican on the panel, was eyeing the
chairmanship with the expectation that Granger would step aside.
(Mark Kirk (R-IL), the second-ranking Republican on the subcommittee, was elected Tuesday night to become the
junior senator from Illinois, the seat once held by Barack Obama.)
So how would subcommittee chairwoman Granger handle the responsibility of writing the State and foreign ops
appropriations bill? Here's what we reported in October:
Although [Granger] supported the bill put forth this year by current chairwoman Nita Lowey CD-N.Y.),
she criticizedthe increases for the foreign-ops budget, saying, ""We also face the continued concern in
our own country about our economy and the devastating effects of skyrocketing deficits and debt."" She's
a strong supporter of a balanced budget amendment, which doesn't bode well for foreign-aid
funding in this dismal fiscal environment.
Granger also serves on the defense subcommittee, placing her at the intersection of the debate over how
to balance the national security budget and shift resources from defense to diplomacy and development.
Here she seems to favor the Pentagon, saying in June, ""I want to be sure that we aren't increasing foreign
aid at the expense of our troops."" Her lack of support of international organizations was criticized by the
group Citizens for Global Solutions, which gave her an ""F"" in its 2007to 2009 rating. Granger is also
on board with efforts to eliminate aid to countries that are not performing on internal reform, as she
explained when expressing opposition to funding of the Senegalese government through the State
Department's Millennium Challenge Corporation. ""We can't just give out money and say we will put up
with whatever you are doing,"" she said.
The committee leadership assignments won't be doled out for at least two to three weeks, our Hill sources report.
But if Granger's bid is successful, she'll be instantly influential. The fiscal 2011 State and Foreign Ops bill still has
not been completed by Congress, despite that the fiscal year began Oct. 1.
The stop gap funding measure that has been funding these programs since then, known as a ""continuing
resolution,"" expires in December. The lame duck Democratic led Congress is unlikely to be able to pass full
appropriations bills on its way out the door, so they will likely pass another short term continuing resolution. That
would leave the final work on the actual bill to the incoming class led by the GOP next year.

child marriage defeat
The defeat of the Child Marriage bill, I fear, is a harbinger of what's to come. After passing the Senate unanimously, there
was every expectation that it would fly through the House on suspension. How this too became an abortion issue is truly
distressing. We have our work more than cut out for us.
On another note, i ran into Ray and Shaista the other night. They were recently in Pakistan and stayed with Zardari the
whole time. It might make sense for someone to brief Ray. Zardari considers him his informal ambassador to the US.

Posted: i7 Dec 2010 03:08 PM PS'
Incoming House Foreign Affairs chairwoman ileana Ros-Lehtinen. (R-FL) defeated a bill Thursday evening that
would have committed the United States to combating forced child marriages abroad, by invoking concerns about
the legislation's cost and that funds could be uses to finance abortions. The episode highlights the tough road that
the °barna administration will face in advancing its women's rights and foreign aid agenda during the next
Congressional session.
Non-governmental organizations, women's rights advocates, and. lawmakers from both parties spent years
developing and lobbying for the ""International Protecting Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act of 2010,"" which
the House failed to pass in a vote Thursday. The bill failed even though 241 Congressmen voted, for it and only 166
voted against, because House Speaker Nancy Petosi (D-CA) brought it up under ""suspension of the rules."" This
procedure has the advantage of not allowing any amendments or changes to the bill, but carries the disadvantage of
requiring two-thirds of the. votes for passage.
; Even still, supporters in both parties fully expected the bill to garner the 290 votes needed -- right up until the bill.
failed. After all, it passed the Senate unanimously Dee. i with the co-sponsorship of several Republicans. including
Appropriations Committee ranking Republican Thad Cochran (R-MS), Foreign Relations Committee member
Roger ‘Vick-er (P.-MS), and human rights advocate Sam Brownback (R-KS).
if passed, the bill would have authorized the president to provide assistance ""to prevent the incidence of child
marriage in developing countries through the promotion of educational, health, economic, social, and legal
empowerment of girls and women."" It would have also mandated that the administration develop a multi-year
strategy on the issue and that the State Department include the incidence of forced child marriage during its annual
evaluation of countries' human rights practices.
So what happened? Ros-Lehtinen first argued that the bill was simply unaffordable. In a Dec. i6""
she objected to the Post of the bill, which would be Si.08 million over five years, and criticized it for not
providing an accounting of how much the U.S. was already spending on this (Alba The '
said the bill would authorize $1o8 million, but would only require $67 million in outlays from fiscal years 2011 to
2015.
Ros-Lehtinen introduced her own version of the bill, which she said would only cost $1 million. But in a fact sheet
gDF.), organizations supporting the original legislation said that Ros-Lehtinen's bill removed the implementation
procedures that gave the legislation teeth. ""Without such activities, the bill becomes merely a strategy with no actual
implementation. And without implementation of a strategy, the bill will have an extraordinarily limited impact,""
they wrote.
Regardless, the supporters still thought the bill would pass because House Republican leadership had not come out
against it. But about one hour before the vote, every Republican House office received a message on the bill
from GOP leadership, known as a Whip Alert, saying that leadership Nyould vote ""no"" on the bill and encouraging all
Republicans do the same. The last line on the alert particularly shocked the supporters.
""There are also concerns that funding will be directed to NGOs that promote and perform abortion and efforts to
combat child marriage could be usurped as a way to overturn pro-life laws,"" the alert read.
The bill doesn't contain any funding for abortion activities and federal funding for abortion activities is already
; prohibited by what's known as the almenè"" which has been boiler plate language in appropriations
bills since 1973.
Invoking the abortion issue sent the bill's supporters reeling. They believed that it was little more than a stunt,
considering that Republican pro-life senators had carefully reviewed the legislation and concluded it would not have
an impact on the abortion issue.
Rep. Stephen LaTourrette (R-OH) - the Republican leadership for invoking the abortion issue to defeat
the forced child marriage act in a floor speech .Friday morning.
""Yesterday I was on the floor and I was a co-sponsor with [on] a piece of legislation with [Rep. Betty McCollum
(D-MN)] that would have moved money, no new money, would have moved money so that societies that are
coercing young girls into marriage... we could make sure that they stay in school so they're not forced into marriage
at the age of 12 and 13,"" LaTourette said. ""Ail of a sudden there was a fiscal argument. When that didn't work people
had to add an abortion element to it. This is a partisan place. I'm a Republican. I'm glad we beat their butt in the
election, but there comes a time when, enough is enough.""
But it was too late for LaTourette and other Republicans who had fought hard for the bill, including Aaron Schoch,
(R-11). The bill is even less likely to pass next year, when the GOP will control the House and Ros-Lehtinen will
control the Foreign Affairs committee.
The main author of the bill was Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), who was incensed when the bill failed
in the House.
-The action on the House floor stopping the Child 'Marriage bill tonight will endanger the lives of millions of women.
and girls around the world,"" Durbin said in a Thursday statement. ""These.voung girls, enslaved in marriage, will be
brutalized and many will die when their young bodies are torn apart while giving birth. Those who voted to continue
this barbaric practice brought shame to Capitol Hill.""
For the NGO and women's advocacy community, the implications of this defeat extend much further than just this
bill. They also saw Republicans invoke the abortion issue when objecting to the International Violence Against
Women Act and expect the new Congress to push for reinstatement of the ""Mexico City Policy,"" which would
prevent federal funding for any organizations that even discuss abortion.
""Any time a health bill that has to do with women and girls comes to the House floor, we're going to see a debate
like the one we just saw,"" said one advocacy leader who supported the bill. ""It's hard to imagine how any
development bills are going to pass in this environment.""
The protection of women and girls is a major focus of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who promised to elevate
the issue Thursday when rolling out the State Department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. She
has said that forced child marriage is ""a clear and unacceptable violation of human rights"", and that ""the
Department of State categorically denounces all cases of child marriage as child abuse"".
State's Ambassador at Large for Global Women's Issues Melanne Verveer has worked hard on the issue behind
the scenes. But at the eleventh hour, when the going got tough, the bill's supporters said that the administration was
nowhere to be found. In October, the White House decided to waive all penalties under the Child Soldiers
Prevention Act, another Durbin led bill that the NCO community supports.
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) estimates that 6o million girls in developing countries now between the
ages of 20 and 24 were married before they reached 18. The Population Council,
reproductive and child health, estimates that the number will increase by too million over the next decade if current
trends continue.
!
One of the two biggest problems identified in the Afghanistan-Pakistan Strategy Review released Thursday (?• :) is
the Pakistani militasy's failure to crack down on some of the terrorist groups using Pakistan's tribal areas as a safe
- haven from which to launch attacks across the border into Afghanistan.
Pakistan • a major offensive, involving approximately go,000 troops, against extremists in South
Waziristan in October 2009, and its military has also undertaken efforts to stamp out militants in other border
areas. However, the military has yet to launch offensive military operations in North Waziristan, where insurgent
groups wreaking havoc in Afghanistan reside.
Pakistan's envoy in Washington, Ambassador Husain Haggai* reacted to the report by saying that Pakistan will
engage isla.mist groups in North Waziristan, including the •Hartgani network (no relation), but only when there is
sufficient support in all areas of Pakistan's government for the effort, and not until they are confident that the
mission can be completed effectively.
""Pakistan has made it very clear that we are fighting terrorists because they are a threat to our own existence as a
modern democratic nation. We will fight all groups in all parts of our country,"" Haqqani said in an exclusive
interview with The Cable. ""But we will follow timelines that suit our own capabilities and can lead to success.""
Haqqani said that the Pakistani army, which has taken the fight to six out of the seven regions inside Pakistan in
which domestic militant groups operate and suffered thousands of casualties in the process, is simply not in a
position to expand its war on the extremists now.
""Right now, it's only a question of operational capability and readiness. Our armed forces have been engaged in
dealing with flood relief work,"" he said. ""We have to see what resources we will allocate in which part of the country,
and those rather than any political factors are responsible for any waiting period.""
He also noted that ""there is a fragile consensus in Pakistan in favor of military action against regional elements,""
and that Pakistan's government has no choice but to make the decision to attack North Waziristan groups on a
timeline that prioritized Pakistani considerations over American ones.
""Sometimes it's easy for our allies to tell us what to do and for us to tell our allies what to do. But everyone makes
decisions based on their own perceptions and analysis of on ground realities,"" Haqqani said.
In several discussions with other Pakistani officials, an even more complicated picture of the Pakistani position on
attacking groups in North Waziristan emerges. The Pakistanis largely believe that the U.S. government is being
unrealistic in terms of the timelines it wants for cracking down on terrorist safe havens along the Afghanistan-
Pakistan border, which have existed for decades.
, ""There will always be a gap between our two countries because the Americans want things done quickly and done
their way,"" another Pakistani government official said.
; A third senior Pakistani official said that many Pakistanis feel that the ()barna administration is placing too much of
the blame on Pakistan for the lank of progress in the 'U.S.-led war in Afghanistan.
'The U.S. keeps telling Pakistan to do more, but Pakistan keeps telling the U.S. to do more on certain questions such
as speeding up building up of Afghan army, establishing a real process toward reconciliation, and providing
Pakistan the means for large scale operations,"" the official said.
The United States has provided Pakistan with several billions of dollars in military and economic aid to support its
war against domestic insurgents. But many in the Pakistani government have criticized what they say characterize
as the slow arrival of these funds, which they say are in any case too small to address Pakistan's severe problems.
""It's very simplistic to measure success in amount of assistance provided to Pakistan,"" one Pakistani official said.
In remarks delivered during the rollout of the strateu review Thursday, President Obama was diplomatic when
discussing his administration's ongoing drive to push Pakistan to do more in North Waziristan.
""Increasingly, the Pakistani government recognizes that terrorist networks in its border regions are a threat to all
our countries, especially Pakistan. We've welcomed major Pakistani offensives in the tribal regions. We will
continue to help strengthen Pakistanis' capacity to root out terrorists,"" said Obama. ""Nevertheless, progress has not
come fast enough. So we will continue to insist to Pakistani leaders that terrorist safe havens within their borders
must be dealt with.""
Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy acknowledged in an interview the same day that there
was more work to be done on the relationship before the Pakistanis were willing to fully support the U.S. and
NATO-led mission in Afghanistan.
""Given the ups and downs of our historical relationship with Pakistan, they fear our abandonment,"" she said. ""Their
calculus is very much affected by the long-term commitment they feel from us and in working in a strategic
partnership.""
The White House recognizes that its efforts have fallen short so far. ""The bottom line is that Pakistan is a country
where we have little influence, little access and little credibility,"" one of Obama's aides to■..-:), The New York Times.
The administration's official line, therefore, is to agree with the Pakistani government and express sensitivity to its
claim that they simply can't expand their war against extremists at this time.
""We would like them to move tomorrow, we would like them to take out these people tomorrow,"" the new U.S.
Ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter. ""But we understand they're telling us honestly about the capacity of
their military, and when they are able, we are convinced they will move in.""
But for many in Washington, the open-ended delay in Pakistan.s promise to expand military operations into North.
Waziristan represents a strategic choice, and is not just a result of the military's operational limitations. But
whatever Pakistan's reasons, the delay doesn't inspire confidence that the Obama administration can meet its
timelines for making progress in Afghanistan.
""Pakistan, meanwhile, iS hedging its bets, supporting proxy actors like the Quetta Shura Taliban and Haos
iani
Network that might counter Indian interests in Kabul after the United States and its allies eventually withdraw,""
Andrew Extnn of the Center for a New American Security. 'The insurgent sanctuaries in Pakistan are one of
the two Achilles heels in the NATO strategy.""

Posted: 17 Dec iOO C 4:42 AM PST
In a rare instance of bipartisanship, the House of Representatives moved to pass a resolution Friday honoring the
life and work of the recently departed Ambassador Richard Holbrooke.
The resolution C, was sponsored by outgoing House Appropriations State and Foreign Ops
Subcommittee chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-NY), and cosponsored by incoming House Foreign Affairs chairwoman
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Howard Berman (D-CA), and Mike Turner (R-OH). The bill is ""a concurrent
resolution honoring the exceptional achievements of Ambassador Richard Holbrooke and recognizing the
significant contributions he has made to United States national security, humanitarian causes and peaceful
resolutions of international conflict.""
""The passing of Ambassador Holbrooke on Monday, December 13th, is a great loss for the American people,"" Lowey
said in a statement. ""One of our nation's most talented diplomats, Richard Holbrooke possessed a fierce
determination and unsurpassed brilliance in advocating for American security, diplomatic, and development
interests around the world - in Southeast Asia and post-Cold War Europe, at the United Nations, and most recently
in Afghanistan and Pakistan. His exceptional accomplishments as a peace-maker, diplomat, writer, scholar,
manager and mentor will define his legacy as one of the true great foreign policy giants of our time.""
Ros-Lehtinen praised Holbrooke as ""one of the most consequential world diplomats of the last half-century,"" and
said that ""his tireless work in pursuit of United States national interests and international peace have put us all in
his debt.""
After praising his career -- which included two stints as assistant secretary of state, peace negotiator in the Balkans,
U.S. ambassador to the U.N., and service as U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan -- Ros-
Lehtinen called for reform of the United Nations and protection of Israel within its bodies.
""In New York at the UN, [Holbrooke] did much of the heavy lifting on Congressionally-led efforts to rein in UN
spending, to make more equitable the dues paid by the United States, and to improve the standing of Israel in that
multinational body,"" she said. ""Sadly, those concerns have returned with a renewed urgency -- with the need for
fundamental reform of UN budget and the virulently anti-Israel UN Human Rights Council -- and the Congress can
only hope to have such a tenacious, principled partner in the future.""

H: First review of your speech. Goad you used Acheson. Sid
aary's Homerun of a Speech
by Tunku Varadarajan
September 8, 2010 I 12:16pm
Clinton speaks at the Council on Foreign Relations September 8, 2010 in Washington,
,
DC. (Mark Wilson / Getty Images) The secretary of State delivered the best speech of the Obama
administration this morning. Tunku Varadarajan on her ""new American moment""—and why she's
better than her boss.
Behold the Hillary Doctrine. And heap abundant gratitude—and rose petals if you have them on hand—on the firm,
unfussy, deeply reassuring woman who has just offered it up to the world.
In the 20 months since this administration began administering (a verb I use only in the loosest sense), the speech
Wednesday morning by Hillary Clinton, delivered at the Council on Foreign Relations, was the first time we have been
given an unreserved lift of the heart by any of its members. It was, by far, the best speech of this administration. Whereas
her president has frequently wrung his elegant hands, doing the rounds of the world to reassure foreign leaders that
America is a cuddly bunny at heart, the secretary of State declared Wednesday that we are all living ""a new American
moment—a moment when our global leadership is essential."" There was no bowing from her to potentates in robes; there
was, instead, a promise that ""we will do everything we can to exercise the traditions of American leadership at home and
abroad.""
What is so piquant here is not the fact that Hillary understands that Obama is president. It is the growing sense that Hillary
would have made a much, much better president than Obama.
Try this for size: ""The United States can, must and will lead in the new century."" In order to do that, Clinton promised ""a
new global architecture,"" ""built to last and withstand stress."" And in a muscular departure from the way in which this
administration—for fear of seeming Bush-like—has been shrinking from the unembarrassed propagation of American
values, she uttered these plainspoken, unadorned words: ""Democracy needs defending.""
X
Human rights, too, came in for a robust airing: China was scolded, and exhorted to follow ""the rules of the road"" in its
aspiration to be a great power; as was Russia, for its invasion of Georgia. The message: We may live in a multipolar
world, but we have higher standards by far than those who would style themselves as our equals.
Clinton used phrases like ""American might,"" words that we are more accustomed to hearing from Republicans—words
that we've come to believe that many Democrats can't bear to voice. How refreshing, therefore, that she should reach into
a vocabulary of pride that most American citizens would applaud.
Hillary Clinton invoked the name of Dean Acheson in her reference to the need for ""good, old-fashioned diplomacy,"" and
there certainly was an air of the Achesonian, of the statesman, about her speech. Good, old-fashioned diplomacy, it
should be noted, is in contrast to Obama's apparent preference for seeing America as a nation like any other, only a bit
bigger, richer, and better-armed. Clinton's ""old-fashioned"" diplomacy is based, by contrast, on the unquestionable premise
that America is the world's leader. Not primus inter pares; just primus.
In her speech, Clinton referred to the sources of ""American might."" The first, of course, is ""economic power."" But it is her
hailing of the second—America's ""moral authority""—that was so invigorating.
It was Acheson who said: ""The most important aspect of the relationship between the president and the secretary of state
is that they both understand who is president."" What is so piquant here, in this administration, is not the fact, plain to
behold, that Hillary understands that Obama is president. It is the growing sense that Hillary would have made a much,
much better president than Obama.

Melanne is stepping through the QDDR and giving specific edits on each section to ensure the integration of gender.
In addition to that help, she shared her thoughts/concerns on the reorganization as it affects s/GWI. We already
determined from your earlier feedback that S/GWI would maintain a direct report to S (I actually always thought that
even with the reorganization of homes for many of the S offices, we still were maintaining a direct S/reporting so we are
revisiting this issue writ-large for the next draft to you. For example, we now know statutorily that S/CT legislatively is a
required S report).
That said, here is her narrative for your review for when we speak. I have embedded comments in caps in text after
each graph where relevant.
TO: Anne-Marie Slaughter
FROM: Melanne Verveer
DATE: November 4, 2010
RE: Gender Integration in the QDDR
The Secretary has declared time and time again that the empowerment of women is ""at the heart of the foreign
policy of the United States."" Our collective task is to realize this principle by integrating gender into the policies and
programs of the State Department and USAID in an enduring way.
We are concerned that the current draft of the QDDR falls short of this call. In the existing draft, the Office of
Global Women's Issues falls under a new Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy and Human Rights while
retaining the Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues who reports directly to the Secretary. This new structure
misses the simple but important reality that women are half of the world's population and that the major security,
economic and social challenges of this century cannot be solved without them. These issues cut across the work of the
department and touch virtually all regions, though we place special emphasis on regions in which women and girls
are most vulnerable, such as in countries experiencing conflict and transition. Locating the office within one bureau
makes it impossible for the Office to implement its very charge — to integrate gender effectively into the work of the
entire State Department.
Therefore, gender must be integrated throughout all of the regional and functional bureaus rather than located
within one bureau. Women should be integral to all of our diplomatic efforts—from traditional bilateral and multilateral
relationships, strategic dialogues, and public diplomacy, to our relations with civil society, community leaders and other
non-state actors. Women are also important to consider in all of our policy initiatives, including global health, food
security, climate change, economic issues, human rights, and peace and security. We must institute rigorous
institutional mechanisms to ensure that all bureaus, both regional and functional, consider gender in diplomacy and
development.
In order to integrate gender effectively throughout the work of the Department, we recommend the following
approach to planning, budgeting, structure and evaluation:
Maintain visibility and focus on gender. Retain the Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues who
reports to the Secretary. This position embodies our commitment to and advocacy for gender equality as an essential
part of diplomacy and development and signals our understanding that this is important to the national security of the
United States. In addition, the office advances a coherent and coordinated strategy on gender throughout the State
Department and USAID. [DONE]
Ensure that gender is effectively addressed throughout all bureaus and missions. We recommend the
following structural changes at State. First, make the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary (PDAS) in all regional and
functional bureaus responsible and accountable for their bureaus' work on gender. The Office of Global Women's Issues
would serve as a resource to the PDAS on these issues. Second, assign specialized gender liaisons to regional bureaus
for purposes of integration, where needed. Third, include training and capacity development for employees on gender
Issues (in both Foreign and Civil Service as well as for political appointees). Fourth, evaluate the PDAS in each bureau on
gender integration in policies and programs (including, for example, as a component in the Performance Evaluation
System). Similarly, require each Chief of Mission to be responsible and accountable for the mission's work on gender, to
assign personnel with expertise to manage the work on gender, to require personnel to receive training on gender
issues, and to be evaluated on this work. A parallel structure should be put in place at USAID, and our diplomacy and
development work on gender should be coordinated and complimentary.
[THIS IS RECOMMENDATION, WITH SOME VARIATION, MADE FOR MANY AREAS — PUBLIC DIPLOMACY,
MULTILATERAL AFFAIRS, AND OTHERS — CHALLENGE WILL BE TO IDENTIFY HOW TO ADDRESS EFFECTIVELY AND CREAT A
PDAS JOB THAT IS MEANINGFUL GIVEN THE NEW RESPONSIBILITIES SOUGHT TO BE IMPOSED THROUGH THAT
POSITION]
Include gender in strategic planning and budget allocation. We recommend continuing the requirement
initiated last year that all bureaus include a plan for gender integration in their annual Strategic Plan and Budget
proposal. Each bureau is required to describe how their policies and programs will improve gender equality and how
that will strengthen their work more generally. They are also required, to the extent possible, to outline what portion of
their policies and programs target or affect women and girls. [THIS ALREADY IS IN PLACE AND WOULD BE RETAINED]
Measure impact. Develop indicators and long-term evaluation systems to measure the impact of programs on
women and girls. There are efforts underway currently within F and at USAID to consider how to improve our
measurement of impact on women and girls and to develop different and additional indicators where
appropriate. [SAME AS IMMEDIATELY ABOVE —THIS IS ALREADY IN PROCESS]
Happy to discuss.

6438,"Post-Daley circus gets started early
Easier to count those who aren't running than those who are
By Rick Pearson, Hal Dardick, Tribune reporters
11:17 PM CDT, September 8,2010
The post-Daley era in Chicago politics began Wednesday with all of the promise of baseball's Opening Day —
no winners, no losers and everyone proclaiming they have a shot at the crown.
With Mayor Richard Daley saying he would not endorse a successor for the Feb. 22 city election, various
political factions engaged in private meetings and a flurry of phone calls aimed at separating the contenders
from the pretenders.
""There will be a lot of candidates,"" Daley said after his first City Council meeting since announcing he would
not seek a seventh term. ""Look at the City Council. All 50 are candidates right now. They all want to be
candidates for mayor and why not? This the best job in America, right here.""
In the anteroom behind the City Council chambers, the scene was controlled chaos as more than a dozen
aldermen — white, black and Latino — happily stepped out of the meeting to give interviews to anyone who
wanted to listen about how they could be the city's next mayor.
But the prospective candidates — following the old political adage that it's ""better to be looked over than
overlooked"" — weren't limited to City Hall.
In Washington, White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel was touted by another Chicagoan, President Barack
Obama's political guru David Axelrod, as having the skills and personality to be a big-city mayor.
Amid all the early jockeying, bluffing and bullying, veteran Aid. Richard Mell, 33rd, outlined the nuts and bolts
reality of mounting a mayoral campaign with only weeks before the Nov. 22 deadline for submitting petitions.
""Someone's got to have some serious money. This isn't something you just decide,"" Mel! said. ""It takes a full-
scale ward-by-ward operation to identify your votes and get them out to vote.""
Mell also talked about the qualities to look for in a winning candidate — someone who will be a ""unifier"" and
""can't be looked at as looking at one segment of the city.""
Still, many politicians were beginning their assessment by gauging the mood of their political base.
""I don't know if it's as important that it's an African-American candidate as it is about a candidate that is going
to be fair to the African-American community,"" said Aid. Walter Burnett, 27th, head of the council's black
caucus, which met in private at the Hotel Allegro across from City Hall.
""For anyone to run for mayor of the city of Chicago there has to be a groundswell of people in the city to
support them ... Everyone has an opportunity.""
At City Hall, amid the swarm of politicians and reporters, U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, a South Side Democrat, said
it was ""critical"" to try to find an African-American contender who would work for the black community's
interests. But the council's black caucus agreed only to try to come up with a list of topics, such as improving
education, that prospective candidates should address.
Latino council members met for lunch and agreed to meet again within the next few weeks, giving potential
candidates time to develop a presentation to make to them.
""If there's a Hispanic that runs, he or she will probably get the majority of the Hispanic vote,"" said Ald. Danny
Solis, 25th.
""I think more than likely it probably, if you look at the numbers, it won't be a Hispanic in the runoff,"" Solis said.
""But then I think we can play a very important role"" in backing one of the remaining candidates.
But such sentiments didn't deter one of the city's most prominent Latino politicians from declaring that he plans
to run. City Clerk Miguel del Valle told the Tribune he planned to make a formal announcement ""down the
road.""
Mell and many others expect the field for the February city election will be too fragmented for any candidate to
reach the winning margin of 50 percent plus one vote. If there is no outright winner, the top two vote-getters
proceed to an April 5 runoff election.
One prominent Northwest Side committeeman, who asked not to be identified because of the early stage of the
campaigns, said the measure of those candidates who are real and those who are seeking an ego boost can be
measured in two numbers: 25,000 and $7 million.
Though 12,500 signatures are needed for the February primary, politicians routinely get double the number to
ensure they make the ballot. As for $7 million, the committeeman said, about $4 million would be needed to
ensure a first or second place finish on Feb. 22, followed by a campaign of about $3 million for the April runoff.
""I'm getting a lot of calls about having lunch,"" said the committeeman. ""I've told them to call me back when
they get the signatures and then we can talk about fundraising.""
Aid. Patrick Levar, 45th, who is not running for mayor, said this power vacuum reminds him of when Mayor
Harold Washington died and Eugene Sawyer was picked to replace him.
""There's a lot of people who are going to be jockeying for position, but I've learned over the years to sit and
listen and see who can put the different coalitions together,"" said Levar, who is also the Northwest Side ward's
Democratic committeeman. ""Whoever can raise the amount of money and put the coalition together is the
person who is going to win.""
While many politicians were starting those discussions, some key Democratic committeemen said they hadn't
heard from Emanuel, one of the most prominent potential candidates.
Emanuel, a former top political aide to Daley and Northwest Side congressman, has previously said he'd like to
be mayor but has avoided the spotlight since Daley's announcement.
Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, told reporters aboard Air Force One that he expected Emanuel
to ""take some time to think about what he wants to do with his future.""
But Axelrod, who previously served as Daley's political adviser, told ABC News that if Emanuel decided
to leave the White House for a mayoral bid, ""the president will support that decision.""
Saying mayors are ""larger than life personalities,"" Axelrod said Emanuel ""has that combination of skills and
that personality and mindset to be a success if he chooses to go that route."""

statement issued here today, the Union Home Minister said that the act is calculated to increase strife between
different religious groups. Following is the text of his statement :
""There are reports of a pastor in the United States threatening to burn the Quran on September 11, 2010.
The US authorities have strongly condemned the statement of the pastor. Religious leaders all over the world
have also condemned his proposed action.
We condemn the action of the pastor. It is totally unbecoming of anyone who claims to be a man of religion. It
is obviously calculated to increase bitterness and strife between different religious groups. No one who is
interested in maintaining harmony and peace among different sections of the people can condone such action.
We hope that the US authorities will take strong action to prevent such an outrage being committed.
While we await the action of the US authorities, we would appeal to the media in India — both print and
visual media — to refrain from telecasting visuals or publishing photographs of the deplorable act. We
would also appeal to the media to exercise great restraint over the next couple of days and help in

India Condemns U.S. Pastor's Plan to Burn the Quran, Urges
Media Restraint
By Bibhudatta Pradhan - Sep 9, 2010
India ""condemns"" a plan by a Florida pastor to burn copies of the Koran and the government hopes the U.S. will
take strong action against him, Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said in New Delhi.
Terry Jones, pastor of the Dove World Outreach Center in Gainesville has been criticized by U.S. Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton and the Vatican for his plan to burn the Muslim holy book on Sept. 11. General David
Petraeus, commander of international coalition forces in Afghanistan, said the act would endanger U.S. troops.
Chidambaram urged Indian newspapers not to publish photographs of what he said would be a ""deplorable act""
and asked television channels to refrain from broadcasting images. The media must show restraint over the
""next couple of days and help in maintaining communal peace and harmony,"" the minister said, reading a
government statement.
The proposed burning ""is totally unbecoming of anyone who claims to be a man of religion,"" Chidambaram
said. About 13 percent of India's 1.2 billion people are Muslim.
Facing mounting criticism around the world and at home, Jones said yesterday that supporters have sent him
copies of the Koran to burn and he was not convinced ""that backing down is the right thing to do,"" Associated
Press reported.

G.O.P. Leader Is Tightly Bound to Lobbyists
By ERIC LIPTON
WASHINGTON — House Democrats were preparing late last year for the first floor vote on the financial regulatory
overhaul when Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio and other Republican leaders summoned more than 100 industry
lobbyists to Capitol Hill for a private strategy session.
The bill's passage in the House already seemed inevitable. But Mr. Boehner and his deputies told the Wall Street
lobbyists and trade association leaders that by teaming up, they could still perhaps block its final passage or at least water
it down.
""We need you to get out there and speak up against this,"" Mr. Boehner said that December afternoon, according to three
people familiar with his remarks, while also warning against cutting side deals with Democrats.
That sort of alliance — they won a few skirmishes, though they lost the war on the regulatory bill — is business as usual
for Mr. Boehner, the House minority leader and would-be speaker if Republicans win the House in November. He
maintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides representing some of the nation's biggest
businesses, including Goldman Sachs, Google, Citigroup, R. J. Reynolds, MillerCoors and UPS.
They have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to his campaigns over the years, provided him rides on their
corporate jets, socialized with him at luxury golf resorts and waterfront bashes and are now leading fund-raising efforts for
his Boehner for Speaker campaign, which is soliciting checks of up to $37,800 each, the maximum allowed.
Some of the lobbyists readily acknowledge routinely seeking his office's help — calling the congressman and his aides as
often as several times a week — to advance their agenda in Washington. And in many cases, Mr. Boehner has helped
them out.
As Democrats increasingly try to cast the Ohio congressman as the face of the Republican Party — President Obama
mentioned his name eight times in a speech last week — and as Mr. Boehner becomes more visible, his ties to lobbyists,
cultivated since he arrived here in 1991, are coming under attack.
The woman he hopes to replace, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, derided him on Friday as having met ""countless times with
special-interest lobbyists in an effort to stop tough legislation"" that would regulate corporations and protect consumers.
And the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, through a spokeswoman, charged that he ""epitomizes the
smoked-filled, backroom, special-interest deal making that turns off voters about Washington.""
Mr. Boehner, who declined to be interviewed for this article, and his lobbyist allies ridicule such criticism as politically
motivated by desperate Democrats. His actions, they say, simply reflect the pro-business, antiregulatory philosophy that
he has espoused for more than three decades, dating back to when Mr. Boehner, the son of a tavern owner, ran a small
plastics company in Ohio. And fielding requests from lobbyists is nothing unusual, he says.
""I get lobbied every day by somebody,"" he said last month after a speech in Cleveland. ""It could be by my wife. It could be
the bellman. It goes on all day, everyday, everyplace.""
Mr. Boehner — a 60-year-old, perpetually tanned, sharply tailored, chain-smoking golfer — is not as fiery as Newt
Gingrich or as unrelenting an arm-twister as Tom DeLay, two of his Republican predecessors in top House posts. It is his
reputation as a ""Chamber of Commerce"" Republican and his fund-raising skills — he has raised $36 million for
Republican causes during this election cycle, more than almost anyone else in his party — that explain, in part, his rise.
If elected as his party's leader in the House, Mr. Boehner will certainly lean on his industry allies for help as he builds
coalitions necessary to push legislation through Congress, his office acknowledges. His friends say there is nothing wrong
with that.
""Does he have a lot of relationships in this city? Yes, absolutely,"" said Mark lsakowitz, a friend whose Republican firm
represents more than three dozen financial, telecommunications, energy and consumer products companies as diverse
as Coca-Cola and Zurich Financial Services. ""But I think all the good lawmakers do.""
Mr. Boehner won some of his first national headlines back in 1996 after he was caught handing out checks from tobacco
lobbyists to fellow Republicans on the House floor. Then the fourth-ranking House Republican, Mr. Boehner said he had
broken no rules and was simply assisting his lobbyist friends, who were contributing to other Republicans' campaigns.
His business-friendly reputation was enhanced through the weekly powwows he organized on Capitol Hill nicknamed the
Thursday Group, a gathering of conservative leaders and business lobbyists whom he relied on to help push the party's
legislative agenda. The Thursday gathering was disbanded after a Republican power struggle that cost him his leadership
position.
But he continued to routinely meet with business leaders, particularly in his role as chairman of the Education and the
Workforce Committee, and returned to power as House G.O.P. leader in 2006. Several of the onetime Thursday regulars,
along with some newcomers, are among the close-knit group that routinely call on Mr. Boehner's office for client matters,
write checks to his campaign and socialize with him.
That tight circle includes Mr. lsakowitz; Bruce Gates, a lobbyist for the cigarette maker Altria; Nicholas E. Calio, a
Citigroup lobbyist; and two former aides, Marc Lampkin and Sam Geduldig, both now financial services lobbyists.
The tobacco industry is particularly well represented, with both Mr. Gates and John Fish, a lobbyist for R. J. Reynolds,
maker of Camel cigarettes, in the group. People affiliated with those companies have contributed at least $340,000 to Mr.
Boehner's political campaigns, with Mr. Gates being the top individual donor among the thousands during Mr. Boehner's
political career, according to a tally by the Center for Public Integrity.
While many lawmakers in each party have networks of donors, lobbyists and former aides who now represent corporate
interests, Mr. Boehner's ties seem especially deep. His clique even has a nickname on Capitol Hill, Boehner Land. The
members of this inner circle said their association with Mr. Boehner translates into open access to him and his staff.
""He likes to bring similarly minded people together to try to advance legislation or oppose it,"" said Drew Maloney, a
lobbyist at Ogilvy Government Relations. ""That is how you get things done.""
One lobbyist in the club — after lauding each staff member in Mr. Boehner's office that he routinely calls to ask for help —
ticked off the list of recent issues for which he had won the lawmaker's backing: combating fee increases for the oil
industry, fighting a proposed cap on debit card fees, protecting tax breaks for hedge fund executives and opposing a cap
on greenhouse gas emissions.
Still, with Mr. Boehner and his party in the minority, they often lost the fights.
But despite the recent string of defeats on the House floor, Mr. Boehner has benefited from his alliance with lobbyists.
From 2000 to 2007, Mr. Boehner flew at least 45 times, often with his wife, Debbie, on corporate jets provided by
companies including R. J. Reynolds. (As required, Mr. Boehner reimbursed part of the costs.)
In addition, over the last decade, he has taken 41 other trips paid for by corporate sponsors or industry groups, often to
popular golf spots. Those trips make him one of the top House beneficiaries of such travel, which has recently been
curbed as a result of changes in ethics rules in Washington.
Mr. Boehner continues to travel to popular golf destinations on a corporate-subsidized tab, although now it is paid for
through his political action committee, the Freedom Project. In the last 18 months, it has spent at least $67,000 at the Ritz
Carlton Naples in Florida, at least $20,000 at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club in Gainesville, Va., and at least $29,000 at
the Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio, federal records show, for fund-raising events.
In June, with the prospects for a Republican takeover of the House rising, Mr. Boehner moved to accelerate his fund-
raising effort, starting what he called the Boehner for Speaker campaign. The idea was to use his high profile to draw
large donations that would be mostly allocated to help elect other House Republicans.
He turned again to the same group of lobbyists, former aides and friends during a July meeting at the headquarters of the
Republican National Committee.
""The wave is there, there is a rebellion in the country, and we have good candidates,"" Mr. Boehner told his supporters,
one of the lobbyists present at the meeting recalled. ""But I don't want to miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity because
we have not raised enough money. They might be able to stop us with a wall of money.""
Mr. Calio of Citigroup was among the first to write a large check. So far, a party spokesman said, the campaign has raised
nearly $2 million. Mr. Boehner has helped raise millions more in the last six weeks for Republican House candidates
across the country and the party, appearing at more than 40 fund-raisers.
The Boehner for Speaker campaign offers donors who give the maximum amount special perks, like ""meetings with
Leader Boehner and much much more.""
But his lobbyist friends and former aides said these incentives did not mean too much, because they already had plenty of
access to Mr. Boehner. They just now want to see him as the speaker of the House.
""He knows this is going to be a tough election,"" said Samuel J. Baptista, a friend, golf partner and lobbyist whose clients
include Goldman Sachs and Discover Financial. ""But people who underestimate him really do so at their own peril."""

BOEHNER taped ""Face the Nation"" yesterday from West Chester, Ohio:
Bob Schieffer: ""I want to make sure I heard what you said correctly: you're saying that you are
willing to vote for those middle class tax cuts, even though the bill will not include ... extending
the tax cuts for the upper bracket American.""
Rep. Boehner: ""Bob, we don't know what the bill's going to say, alright? If the only option I
have is to vote for those at 250 and below, of course I'm going to do that. But I'm going to do
everything I can to fight to make sure that we extend the current tax rates for all Americans.""
A Boehner aide reads between the lines: ""Despite what Obama says, Republicans are not
holding middle-class tax cuts hostage and we're not going to let him get away with those types of
false claims. Our focus remains on getting bipartisan support for a freeze on all current rates,
because that is what is best for the economy and small business job creation. Boehner's words
were calculated to deprive Obama of the ability to continue making those false claims, and as a
result we are in a better position rhetorically to pressure more Democrats to support a full
freeze.""
AN INSTANT CLASSIC:
Schieffer: ""Mr. Boehner, I'm going to ask you this question because I'm not objective about this
- I'm a cancer survivor, I used to be a heavy smoker. Do you still smoke?""
Boehner: ""I do.""
Schieffer: ""You have taken $340,000 from the tobacco industry. They've been the largest
contributor to your political campaigns over the year. How do you square that with the fact that
cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable deaths in this country, 435,000 people,
their deaths are linked to cancer, that's 1 in 5. How do you justify that in your own mind?""
Boehner:i""Bob, tobacco is a legal product in America. The American people have a right to
decide for themselves whether they want to partake or not. There are lots of things that we deal
with and come in contact with every day, from alcohol to food to cigarettes, a lot of the things
that aren't good for our health. But the American people ought to have the right to make those
decisions on their own."" ...
Schleifer: ""If you should become Speaker, you could set a good example for the country by
saying, 'I'm going to stop smoking.' Maybe you could get the President, I understand he smokes
too, maybe the two of you could find a way to try to stop smoking. That'd be kind of a good
thing, wouldn't it?""
I Boehner: ""Bob, I appreciate your suggestion."""

Karl Rove is back in business -- directing tens of millions in secret corporate cash to GOP campaigns to
hijack our elections and our public discourse. If he's successful, John Boehner will become Speaker of the
House. But the last thing Rove wants is for Boehner to be seen as the face of the GOP. That's why he's
claiming it's an —inexplicable— mistake for President Obama to put Boehner front and center. Progressives
know better than to take advice from Rove.
Our new message testing shows that progressives should not only talk about Boehner but define him and
his agenda. Every narrative we tested about Boehner -- from his loyalty to special interests and
corporate donors over the interests of the middle class to Karl Rove's efforts to elevate him as
Speaker -- beat the Republicans"" toughest attack language on Obama, Pelosi and Reid. Currently,
Boehner is largely unknown, but when voters are told about him, they don't like what they hear.
The following """"one-liners"" beat GOP attack rhetoric by double digits with both likely and swing

C.,' We need moderation, not extremism. If John Boehner wants to speak for a party that has
vowed to end Social Security, Medicare and public education--and force women who""ve
been raped to bear their rapist's child--that's his business. But he doesn""t speak for America
or American values.

KEYS TO CONNECTING
1. Emphasize whose voices matter to Boehner: Voters want a Speaker who listens to the voice of the people,
not the big corporations and lobbyists who Boehner represents.
2.Draw a strong contrast between the interests of working Americans and the special interests of powerful
corporations: Speak strongly to populist themes that focus on the loyalty of Boehner and the Republicans in
Congress to their corporate donors, like the tobacco CEOs whose campaign donations Boehner handed out on
the House floor, over the interests and values of ordinary Americans.
3.Focus on realities that are hard for Boehner to defend: the social and economic extremism of his party and
his long history in Washington helping to create the problems we face today.
NARRATIVES THAT BEAT THE GOP ATTACK
Longer narratives against Boehner beat a similar, but more in-depth Republican message, based on language
drawn directly from Boehner and other conservative leaders:

i We surveyed a national sample of 1,013 adults matching the demographics of registered voters from October 2-3, 2010
using online dial testing. We
analyzed their responses as they listened to narratives to understand what they found compelling, as well as their overall
ratings of each narrative and
additional ""one-liners."" The numbers reported here are likely underestimates of the strength of the narratives, as the
statistics refer to the original narratives
tested prior to revising them based on analysis of online dial tests.
ii Swing voters are defined as those who described themselves as anywhere from weak/moderate Republicans through
Independents to weak/moderate
Democrats.
THE REPUBLICAN ATTACK ON OBAMA, PELOS1 AND REID
Obama, Pelosi and Reid have abused their power to impose an expansive and intrusive government and destroyed our
economy in the process. Democrats think they can get away with their job-killing agenda by ramming it down people's
throats, excluding opposing viewpoints and eliminating fair debate. They are turning their backs on American families
and businesses as they continue to tax, borrow and spend into oblivion. John Boehner and the Republicans believe
government should reflect the priorities of the American people--priorities that have been ignored, even mocked by the
powers-that-be in Washington. Obama, Pelosi and Reid must be stopped from raising taxes on any American during a
recession and spending money we don""t have on big government programs no one wants. John Boehner and the
Republicans are listening to the American people and understand that government is not the answer, it's the problem.
""Boehner and Rove""- After the Iraq War went south and the economy went under, most of us
thought we""d never hear again from Karl Rove, the architect of the Bush revolution. But Rove is
back in business, directing tens of millions in secret corporate cash to hijack our elections, running
ads against Members of Congress who want to put the public interest over the special interests.
He and John Boehner aren't working for ordinary Americans. They""re working for the big
corporations that outsource our jobs and get tax breaks for doing it. Boehner""s voted down the
line for big bonuses for bankers, big tax breaks for big oil, and big loopholes for insurance
companies that discriminate against people with ""pre-existing conditions"" which is all of us if we
just live long enough. We should be restoring the American Dream for all Americans, not just for
the few, and we need a Speaker who stands with the middle class.
""They found their man""- We need to return to government of, by, and for the people, not
government of, bought, and paid for by special interests. It""s time billionaires and big businesses

loopholes. They""re putting a lot of money into John Boehner, and for good reason: they know as
Speaker, he""d speak for them, not for ordinary Americans. Just ask the tobacco company CEOs
whose campaign donations he handed out on the floor of the House of Representatives—which is
supposed to be the People's House, not the smokers"" lounge. Or ask the bankers who played
Russian roulette with our homes and jobs, who got out their checkbooks as he and his fellow
Republicans held a special meeting with them this summer promising to block any efforts to hold
Wall Street accountable. We need a Speaker whose voice is our voice, who'll spend less time
working on his tan and more time working on the problems of middle class Americans.

New BBG chief wants more money to combat ""enemies"" such as China and Russia Posted By Josh Rogin Tuesday,
October 5, 2010 - 4:43 PM
The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) has a new chairman in Walter Isaacson, and the former CNN and Time
magazine chief is calling for even more money for the BBG to combat the public diplomacy efforts of America's
""enemies,"" which he identifies as Iran, Venezuela, Russia, and China.
The BBG, which oversees a $700 million annual budget to run such organizations as the Voice of America, Radio Free
Europe, and Radio Free Asia, funds breakthrough reporting in some of the most dangerous parts of the world, but at the
same time is facing increased competition from other governments' forays into international broadcasting.
Isaacson said that other countries are stepping up their international broadcasting efforts and that the Congress must
allow the U.S. government to do the same.
""We can't allow ourselves to be out-communicated by our enemies,"" he said. ""You've got Russia Today, Iran's Press TV,
Venezuela's TeleSUR, and of course, China is launching an international broadcasting 24-hour news channel with
correspondents around the world [and has] reportedly set aside six to ten billion [dollars] -- we've to go to Capitol Hill
with that number -- to expand their overseas media operations.""
Isaacson said that combating internet censorship would be a major focus of the BBG under his leadership and that China
and Iran were the prime targets.
""China, Iran, and other countries block democratic impulses using their later technologies, and Beijing has deployed
armies of cyber militias to go after their country's cyber dissidents,"" he said. ""The BBG is at the forefront of combating
this. Through constant innovation and technical evolution, our engineers are opening up the Internet gateway for
audiences in China and Iran.""
""We know where we stand in the fight for Internet freedom,"" Isaacson said. ""Wherever there is a firewall, it's our duty
to storm it, to denounce it and to circumvent it.""
Isaacson was speaking at last week's 60th anniversary celebration for Radio Free Europe, which he credited as
contributing to the end of the Cold War. He made it clear the BBG's outlets will stick to reporting the news objectively,
even if that conflicts with the foreign policy of the Obama administration.
""It's sometimes said that our international broadcasting is in a difficult position because by law and by tradition it's
tasked with two separate missions that might conflict: first of all, covering the news with the highest journalistic
standards and secondly, being a part of America's public diplomacy by accurately conveying its policies and values to the
world,"" Isaacson said.
""Let me say to you, my fellow journalists, that I will stress and we will stress the primacy of the first of these missions,
our mission of being credible journalists, because in fact, it's the only way to carry out the second mission. You can't do
it unless you're credible and telling the truth, and in the end, the truth is on our side.""
Pressed by The Cable to explain exactly what that means, especially in light of reports that the Obama administration
sought to influence BBG reporting after the disputed Iranian presidential elections, Isaacson promised he wouldn't
hesitate to air views that contradict American foreign policy on BBG stations.
He said that the goals of American foreign policy and the objectives of credible journalism overlap about 90 percent of
the time -- as for the other 10 percent, a choice must be made.
""I feel it's the role of the BBG to always make the choice on the side of credible journalism, just as you would in the
private sector,"" Isaacson said. ""We can never compromise our credibility. And in doing so, that will probably help further
the foreign policy interests of the United States. But if it's ever a real conflict, our goal one is to protect our credibility."""

6567,"I thought that you might enjoy this by our newest S/P member, who was a journalist for the Wall Street Journalist and
other places before she joined us in September. She is on an International Affairs Fellowship from the Council on Foreign
Relations. They asked her to write the following; it was cleared by L. It is quite profound.
By EMILY PARKER
In 2007 I flew down to Lima to interview Mario Vargas Llosa for this newspaper. We talked in his elegant home,
surrounded by thousands of books. Mr. Vargas Llosa offered me a glass of red wine. Then he proceeded to
discuss why he believes that literature can change the world.
Mr. Vargas Llosa's Nobel Prize is a great victory—and not just for a talented and prolific author. His work is
perhaps the greatest rebuttal to those who believe that literature exists on the periphery of history and politics,
or who claim that they have ""no time"" for fiction.
In a New Republic essay in 2001, Mr. Vargas Llosa argued for granting literature ""an important place in the life
of nations."" He wrote, 'Without it, the critical mind, which is the real engine of historical change and the best
protector of liberty, would suffer an irreparable loss.""
Mr. Vargas Llosa's novels reflect his deep, personal hatred of dictatorships and his staunch belief in the value
of individual liberty. He is hardly the only novelist to have shed light on these themes, but I would argue that he
is among the most successful.
Columnist Mary Anastasia O'Grady on the anti-Communist Peruvian writer.
A case in point is ""Conversation in the Cathedral,"" the work that Mr. Vargas Llosa has said he would rescue
first from a fire. The novel is set in Peru, in the dark days of the Manuel Odria dictatorship of the 1950s, which
is when Mr. Vargas Llosa grew up. He told me that this was the book in which he wanted to describe how
dictatorships impregnate ""every act of life.""
To demonstrate this, Mr. Vargas Llosa paints around Odria rather than confronting him outright. The book
opens with a grim landscape of ""uneven and faded buildings"" and describes ""dull and defeated eyes at the
tables of Zela bar, hands that reach for ashtrays and glasses of beer."" The narrative, which rapidly jumps from
past to present, describes a stalled, confused world. You don't know who to trust.
Mr. Vargas Llosa attacks politics more openly in ""The Feast of the Goat,"" which explicitly details the horrors of
the Trujillo regime in the Dominican Republic. Rafael Trujillo was notorious for his victimization of women, and
so we see life under his rule through the eyes of one young girl unlucky enough to have crossed his path. ""The
woman is almost always the first victim of a dictatorship,"" Mr. Vargas Llosa told me.
For some, Mr. Vargas Llosa's victory will be controversial because of his political background and his
outspoken views. He unsuccessfully ran for president of Peru in 1990, losing to Alberto Fujimori. During the
campaign Mr. Vargas Llosa gained notoriety for his emphasis on a market economy, free trade and private
property. He was no less controversial for his support of the invasion of Iraq, which he saw as necessary to
ending what he called the ""monstrous dictatorship"" of Saddam Hussein.
Mr. Vargas Llosa has now left politics, and he believes that he can better shape the world with his pen. Or as
he told me in Lima: 'Through writing, one can change history.""
Not all of his work is dark. ""Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter"" is punctuated with humor, and 'The Bad Girl,"" about
one man's world-wide pursuit of an elusive lover, is a thoroughly entertaining read. The one constant is a
perceptive and empathetic glimpse into a wide range of human experience.
As Mr. Vargas Llosa wrote in his 2001 essay about literature, ""Nothing better protects a human being against
the stupidity of prejudice, racism, religious or political sectarianism, and exclusivist nationalism than this truth
that invariably appears in great literature: that men and women of all nations and places are essentially equal.""

According to news reports, today Republican minority leader and Coppertone model John Boehner will give his ""closing
argument"" to the American people on why they should throw out the Democrats and kill the Obama-Pelosi-Reid ""job-
killing agenda."" He will be returning to his working class roots, speaking at a piping manufacturing plant, an unusual venue
these days for a man who is seen much more frequently at gatherings of Wall Street executives with open checkbooks
and the males-only country club where he works on his tan when not making the rounds at other clubs with industry
lobbyists.
Either the Speaker-to-be is following the model of Michael Steele and free-lancing, or Karl Rove and the Republicans
believe it is safe or even advantageous to bring him out in public after the White House made an effort to put Boehner's
face on what a Republican majority might look like, with the president invoking his name eight times in one speech.
I have to admit that at the time I was agnostic as to whether it made sense to try to brand him at this late date, as Boehner
has minimal name recognition among voters. But the White House was no doubt responding to three realities.
First, Boehner is an unknown to most Americans, which means that, unlike most Republicans in the news, he has not
been well branded by the GOP -- which means for once Democrats might actually brand someone or something first
rather than playing catch-up. Second, Boehner would indeed be the highest-ranking Republican were the GOP to assume
control over the House (other than of course Karl Rove, who is now directing traffic on the right side of the street in
Washington again). And third, a concrete face is always better than an abstraction when telling a story, and other than
perhaps Sarah Palin, who Republicans could alternately accept and decline as the leader of their party, Boehner's tanned
visage and history as errand-boy for virtually every major corporate special interest in his two decades in Washington
(including his stint as the Marlboro Man, handing out tobacco lobby campaign checks to his fellow Republicans on the
floor of the House) made him a potential counter-villain to the Republican's bogeywoman, Nancy Pelosi.
I remained agnostic until this week, when colleagues at Media Matters Action Network and I conducted a national
5urye:y with 1,000 registered voters, selected to match the demographics of the voting and likely voting
populations. The goal was to see how effectively we could speak with voters about Boehner as not only the symbol and
standard-bearer for the GOP but also the water-boy for corporate America. (The results were surprisingly similar whether
we looked at registered voters or likely voters, although as others have described, precisely how to determine who is a
""likely voter"" in this election is as much art as science, and the point of good messaging at this point is actually to change
the dynamics of likely voting, not just to reflect them.)
As detailed in a memo published in Politico, what we found was clear: Boehner is a target well worth defining, who readily
stands for precisely what Americans perceive to be the reasons they would have to hold their noses to vote for
Congressional Republicans (perhaps the only group left who poll worse than Congressional Democrats with swing
voters). We tested both paragraph-length narratives and single-sentence language designed to capture the essence of
those narratives, and in each case, we tested them against the toughest opposition language we could test them against:
the words of Boehner, Cantor, Limbaugh and others combined in defining the ""Obama-Pelosi-Reid"" agenda.
What we found, in brief: is that we could beat a tough GOP narrative about the ""job-killing"" socialists in the White House
and Congress by 15 to 20 points with two narratives starring Boehner in the leading role (with best supporting bad actor
going in one of the narratives to Karl Rove and his corporate allies), and we could win with over 15 different sentence-long
descriptions of ""what's the matter with Boehner"" with margins ranging from 10 to 60 points against a tough conservative
attack on the Obama-Pelosi-Reid axis of conservative evil.
The narratives that most moved likely voters -- including swing voters, who preferred them by double-digits over tough
Republican rhetoric -- made clear whose voices Boehner would be speaking for as Speaker (e.g., the Wall Street
executives he convened to try to block Wall Street reform). They harnessed the same populist anger at the hijacking of
Washington by corporate special interests that has enlivened the tea partiers and is palpable across the political
spectrum, and they focused on the extremism of the party Boehner would Speak for. A narrative that brought Karl Rove
into the picture was slightly more polarizing with swing voters but slightly more powerful with likely Democratic voters.
In some ways what was most surprising was the success of the single-line statements of what we need in a Speaker and
who John Boehner really speaks for (although these single-line statements came after the narratives, and likely reflect the
power of branding, even over the course of a brief online encounter with voters). They ranged from relatively lofty and
aspirational (e.g., ""We need a Speaker who is also a listener, who can hear the voices of ordinary Americans"" -- a theme
colleagues and I found highly resonant across the political spectrum in message testing on the role of money in politics) --
to the harder-edged (e.g., ""The Speaker of the House is a heartbeat away from the Presidency. Unfortunately, we know
where John Boehner's heart is, and it isn't with the middle class,"" or ""John Boehner understands deficits. He's spent
nearly 20 years in Washington creating them."")
If there's a message in this message research, it is at once short-term and long-term. In the short run, if Democrats want
to hang onto their seats in November, they would do well to define this election in terms of the middle class and small
business versus the billionaires and big corporations that are hijacking our democracy; to use Boehner as a poster child
for the party whose primary commitment is to the latter and whose tan is a testament to that commitment; and to avoid
giving voters reason to regret their vote if they give it to Democrats again this time, by supporting the things they say they
stand for and avoiding that golden mean between the public interest and the special interests that finance campaigns on
both sides of the aisle.
In the longer run, branding matters. One of the biggest strategic and messaging mistakes of the last two years was the
failure of Democrats to brand their opponents while their opponents were busy branding them -- and in particular the
failure to brand the Bush Recession as the natural consequence of faded Republican economic principles. Two years ago,
that was a virtually uncontested political proposition, as the voters made clear in handing Democrats the White House and
supermajorities in both the House and Senate. Today, the public is split down the middle as to who caused the recession.
Reality doesn't brand itself. Hopefully it won't take a debacle in November and another 10 million jobs lost for reality to
unveil itself again for a brief political moment and for progressives to have a second bite at the apple."

H: Dems should demand Boehner remove this GOP Nazi reenactor. Put Boehner in this
blitzkrieg. Sid
Why is This GOP House Candidate Dressed as
a Nazi?
By Joshua Green
An election year already notable for its menagerie of extreme and unusual candidates can add another one: Rich lott, the
Republican nominee for Congress from Ohio's 9th District, and a Tea Party favorite, who for years donned a German
Waffen SS uniform and participated in Nazi re-enactments.
Rich lott, second from right, in a Nazi SS Waffen uniform.
lott, whose district lies in Northwest Ohio, was involved with a group that calls itself Wiking, whose members are devoted
to re-enacting the exploits of an actual Nazi division, the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking, which fought mainly on the
Eastern Front during World War 11. lott's participation in the Wiking group is not mentioned on his campaign's website, and
his name and photographs were removed from the Wiking website.When contacted by The Atlantic, lott confirmed his
involvement with the group over a number of years, but said his interest in Nazi Germany was historical and he does not
subscribe to the tenets of Nazism. ""No, absolutely not,"" he said. ""In fact, there's a disclaimer on the [Wiking] website. And
you'll find that on almost any reenactment website. it's purely historical interest in World War II.""
Rich lott and his wife, as shown on his campaign website.
lott, a member of the Ohio Military Reserve, added, ""I've always been fascinated by the fact that here was a relatively
small country that from a strictly military point of view accomplished incredible things. I mean, they took over most of
Europe and Russia, and it really took the combined effort of the free world to defeat them. From a purely historical military
point of view, that's incredible.""
lott says the group chose the Wiking division in part because it fought on the Eastern Front, mainly against the Russian
Army, and not U.S. or British soldiers. The group's website includes a lengthy history of the Wiking unit, a recruitment
video, and footage of goose-stepping German soldiers marching in the Warsaw victory parade after Poland fell in 1939.
The website makes scant mention of the atrocities committed by the Waffen SS, and includes only a glancing reference to
the ""twisted"" nature of Nazism. Instead, it emphasizes how the Wiking unit fought Bolshevist Communism:
Nazi Germany had no problem in recruiting the multitudes of volunteers willing to lay down their lives to
ensure a ""New and Free Europe"", free of the threat of Communism. National Socialism was seen by -
many in Holland, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and other eastern European and Balkan countries as the
protector of personal freedom and their very way of life, despite the true underlying totalitarian (and quite
twisted, in most cases) nature of the movement. Regardless, thousands upon thousands of valiant men
died defending their respective countries in the name of a better tomorrow. We salute these idealists; no
matter how unsavory the Nazi government was, the front-line soldiers of the Waffen-SS (in particular the
foreign volunteers) gave their lives for their loved ones and a basic desire to be free.
Historians of Nazi Germany vehemently dispute this characterization. ""These guys don't know their history,"" said Charles
W. Sydnor, Jr., a retired history professor and author of ""Soldiers of Destruction: The SS Death's Head Division, 1933-45,""
which chronicles an SS division. ""They have a sanitized, romanticized view of what occurred."" Sydnor added that re-
enactments like the Wiking group's are illegal in Germany and Austria. ""If you were to put on an SS uniform in Germany
today, you'd be arrested.""
See web-only content:
http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/10/why-is-this-gop-house-candidate-dressed-as-a-nazi/64319/
Christopher Browning, a professor of history at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said, ""It is so unhistorical and
so apologetic that you don't know to what degree they've simply caught up innocent war memorabilia enthusiasts who
love putting on uniforms.""
loft says he does not recall exactly when he joined the Wiking group (his name appears on a unit roster as far back as
2003), but did so with his son ""as a father-son bonding thing."" He says his name and pictures were removed from the
Wiking website not out of concern that they would harm his political career, but because he quit the group three years
ago, after his son lost interest.
loft participated in the group under his own name, and also under the alias ""Reinhard Pferdmann,"" which has also been
removed, and which lott described as being his German alter ego. ""Part of the reenactor's [experience],"" lott said, ""is the
living-history part, of really trying to get into the persona of the time period. In many, not just in our unit, but in many units
what individuals do is create this person largely based on a Germanized version of their name, and a history kind of based
around your own real experiences. 'Reinhard' of course is 'Richard' in German. And 'Pferdmann,""pferd' is a horse. So it's
literally 'horse man.""
Asked whether his participation in a Nazi re-enactor's group might not upset voters, particularly Jewish voters, loft said he
hoped it would not: ""They have to take it in context. There's reenactors out there who do everything. You couldn't do Civil
War re-enacting if somebody didn't play the role of the Confederates. [This] is something that's definitely way in the past.
... [I hope voters] take it in context and see it for what it is, an interest in World War II history. And that's strictly all.""
0
lott at Nazi re-enactment.
Rabbi Moshe Saks, of the Congregation B'nai Israel in Sylvania, Ohio, a suburb of Toledo that sits in the 9th district,
disagreed. ""Any kind of reenactment or glorification of Nazi Germany, to us, would be something unacceptable and
certainly in poor taste, if not offensive,"" he said. ""I think the reaction here will be very negative. And not just among the
Jewish community, but the broader community.""
In a follow-up email today, loft seemed at pains to address concerns that his conduct may have alienated veterans groups
but made no specific mention of possible offense to Jews or human rights groups: ""Never, in any of my reenacting of
military history, have I meant any disrespect to anyone who served in our military or anyone who has been affected by the
tragedy of war. In fact, I have immense respect for veterans who served our country valiantly, and my respect of the
military and our veterans is one of the reasons I have actively studied military history throughout my life."" He added that
he has participated in re-enactments as a Civil War Union infantryman, a World War I dough boy and World War II
American infantryman and paratrooper.
The actual Wiking unit has a history as grisly as that of other Nazi divisions. In her book ""The Death Marches of
Hungarian Jews Through Austria in the Spring of 1945,"" Eleonore Lappin, the noted Austrian historian, writes that soldiers
from the Wiking division were involved in the killing of Hungarian Jews in March and April 1945, before surrendering to
American forces in Austria.
""What you often hear is that the [Wiking] division was never formally accused of anything, but that's kind of a dodge,"" says
Prof. Rob Citino, of the Military History Center at the University of North Texas, who examined the Wiking website. ""The
entire German war effort in the East was a racial crusade to rid the world of 'subhumans,' Slays were going to be enslaved
in numbers of tens of millions. And of course the multimillion Jewish population of Eastern Europe was going to be
exterminated altogether. That's what all these folks were doing in the East. It sends a shiver up my spine to think that
people want to dress up and play SS on the weekend.""

Chinese do nothing to correct the record.

risks involved. I aksed for it a couple of weeks ago so hopefully they will have something we can use now which might be
helpful in drafting a response.
In terms of the security arguments he makes, it is worth noting that the incidents he references are situations where the
attacks occured in places where there was NO USG branding. The reality is that the terrorists attack any group or

The Political Scene
Confounding Fathers
The Tea Party's Cold War roots.
by Sean Wilentz October 18, 2010
ann Beck's view of American history stems from the paranoid politics of the fifties.
A few months ago, the cable-television and radio host Glenn Beck began his Fox News show with one of his favorite
props: a pipe clenched between his teeth. ""I've got my pipe,"" he told his audience, his speech slightly muddled by the
stem, ""because we're going to speak about schoolish kind of things."" The theme of the day was ""Restoring History,"" and
Beck, looking professorial in a neat dark blazer and a pink button-down shirt, began the lesson by peering at a stack of
history textbooks and pronouncing them full of falsehoods, produced by ""malicious progressive intent."" Progressives, he
explained—liberals, socialists, Communists, the entire spectrum of the left—""knew they had to separate us from our
history to be able to separate us from our Constitution and God."" For the next hour, Beck earnestly explained some of the
history that ""is being stolen from us"": the depression of 1920, for example, or how conservative economics saved the
nation from the ""near-depression"" of 1946—crises that progressives don't want you to know about. ""You've been taught
one lie, I think, your whole life,"" he said.
For the fractious Tea Party movement, Beck—a former drive-time radio jockey, a recovering alcoholic, and a Mormon
convert—has emerged as both a unifying figure and an intellectual guide. One opinion poll, released in July by
Democracy Corps, showed that he is ""the most highly regarded individual among Tea Party supporters,"" seen not merely
as an entertainer, like Rush Limbaugh, but as an ""educator."" And in the past few months Beck has established his own
institute of learning: the online, for-profit Beck University. Enrollees can take courses like Faith 102, which contends with
""revisionists and secular progressives"" about the separation of church and state; Hope 102, an attack on the activist
federal government; and the combined Charity 101/102/103, a highly restrictive interpretation of rights, federalism, and the
division of powers.
During the ""Restoring History"" episode, Beck twice encouraged viewers to join his Web seminars, where they can hear
""lessons from the best and brightest historians and scholars that we could find."" The B.U. faculty consists of three
members, including one bona-fide academic, James R. Stoner, Jr., the chair of the political-science department at
Louisiana State University; the other two are the head of a management consulting firm and the founder of WallBuilders,
which the Web site calls ""a national pro-family organization."" Beck himself often acts as a professor, a slightly jocular one,
on his Fox News program. Surrounded by charts and figures, he offers explanations of current politics and history lessons
about the country's long march to Obama-era totalitarianism. The decline, he says, began with the Progressive era of the
early twentieth century, in particular with the Presidency of Woodrow Wilson, when both the Federal Reserve System and
the graduated federal income tax came into existence. ""Wilson,"" Beck told his radio audience in August, ""just despised
what America was.""
Beck's claims have found an audience among Tea Party spokesmen and sympathizers. At the movement's Freedom
Summit in Washington last September, one activist told a reporter, ""The election between Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow
Wilson in 1912 was when it started going downhill."" And in April an angry member of the Tea Party Patriots group from
Cape Fear, North Carolina, claimed on the group's Web site that ""the very things you see happening in this country today
started with the Wilson Administration.""
At a Tax Day rally this past spring, the veteran conservative organizer Richard Viguerie described the Tea Party as ""an
unfettered new force of the middle class."" And, indeed, calling Obama a socialist in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson is
audacious enough to seem like the marker of a new movement—or, at least, a new twist in the nation's long history of
conspiracy-mongering. In fact, it marks a revival of ideas that circulated on the extremist right half a century ago,
especially in the John Birch Society and among its admirers.
Beck's version of American history relies on lessons from his own acknowledged inspiration, the late right-wing writer W.
Cleon Skousen, and also restates charges made by the Birch Society's founder, Robert Welch. The political universe is,
of course, very different today from what it was during the Cold War. Yet the Birchers' politics and their view of American
history—which focussed more on totalitarian threats at home than on those posed by the Soviet Union and Communist
China—has proved remarkably persistent. The pressing historical question is how extremist ideas held at bay for decades
inside the Republican Party have exploded anew—and why, this time, Party leaders have done virtually nothing to
challenge those ideas, and a great deal to abet them.
The early nineteen-sixties were a turbulent time in American politics, for the right wing in particular. In the South, racist
violence against civil-rights workers was constant, deepening sectional splits in the Democratic Party that would in time
deliver the once solidly Democratic South to the Republicans. Southern elected officials, in support of what they called
""massive resistance"" to civil-rights laws and judicial rulings, resurrected the ideas of nullification and interposition, which
claimed that individual states could void federal laws within their own borders. Others focussed on what they considered a
fearsome Communist menace inside the United States. General Edwin A. Walker caused an enormous stir when he
resigned from the Army in 1961, after President John F. Kennedy's Pentagon reprimanded him for spreading right-wing
propaganda among his troops and accusing prominent American officials of Communist sympathies. Senator Strom
Thurmond, the Dixiecrat from South Carolina, spoke for many on the far right when he declared that various modestly
liberal domestic programs ""fall clearly within the category of socialism.""
The John Birch Society was one of the decade's most controversial right-wing organizations. Founded in 1958 by Robert
Welch, a candy manufacturer from Massachusetts, the society took its name from a Baptist missionary and military-
intelligence officer killed by Communist Chinese forces in 1945, whom Welch called the first American casualty of the
Cold War. The group was founded at a propitious time. After Senator Joseph McCarthy's fall, in 1954, many of McCarthy's
followers felt bereft of a voice, and Welch seemed to speak for them; by the mid-sixties, his society's membership was
estimated to be as high as a hundred thousand. Welch, exploiting fears of what McCarthy had called an ""immense""
domestic conspiracy, declared that the federal government had already fallen into the Communists' clutches. In a tract
titled ""The Politician,"" he attacked President Dwight D. Eisenhower as ""a dedicated, conscious agent of the Communist
conspiracy"" who had been serving the plot ""all of his adult life."" Late in 1961, after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion, he
accused the Kennedy Administration of ""helping the Communists everywhere in the world while pretending to do the
opposite.""
Wherever he looked, Welch saw Communist forces manipulating American economic and foreign policy on behalf of
totalitarianism. But within the United States, he believed, the subversion had actually begun years before the Bolshevik
Revolution. Conflating modern liberalism and totalitarianism, Welch described government as ""always and inevitably an
enemy of individual freedom."" Consequently, he charged, the Progressive era, which expanded the federal government's
role in curbing social and economic ills, was a dire period in our history, and Woodrow Wilson ""more than any other one
man started this nation on its present road to totalitarianism.""
In the nineteen-sixties, Welch became convinced that even the Communist movement was but ""a tool of the total
conspiracy."" This master conspiracy, he said, had forerunners in ancient Sparta, and sprang fully to life in the eighteenth
century, in the ""uniformly Satanic creed and program"" of the Bavarian Illuminati. Run by those he called ""the Insiders,"" the
conspiracy resided chiefly in international families of financiers, such as the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers, government
agencies like the Federal Reserve System and the Internal Revenue Service, and nongovernmental organizations like the
Bilderberg Group, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Trilateral Commission. Since the early twentieth century, they
had done a good deal of their evil work under the guise of humanitarian uplift. ""One broad avenue down which these
conspiratorial forces advance was known as progressive legislation,"" Welch declared in 1966. ""The very same collectivist
theories and demagogic pretenses which had destroyed earlier civilizations were now paraded forth in the disguise of new
and modern concepts.""
In the worst case, Welch believed, military action might be necessary to dislodge the totalitarians. But for the moment a
nonviolent political revolution would suffice. Accordingly, he designed the Birch Society roughly, if not explicitly, on the
Marxist-Leninist model of a vanguard revolutionary party: a series of small cells that would work in secret to agitate the
populace and elect right-thinking candidates to office. ""It isn't numbers we have to worry about,"" Welch wrote, ""but the
courage on the part of our followers to stick their necks out and play rough—the same as the Communists do.""
The ""Founder"" himself would dictate the society's policies, advised by a council of about two dozen businessmen and
professionals, and the local cells would be overseen by unyielding commanders. ""It is the leadership that is most
demanding, most exacting of its followers,"" Welch observed, ""that achieves really dedicated support."" Welch's group
became synonymous with right-wing extremism, earning satirical blasts from critics ranging from the cartoonist Walt Kelly
to the musicians Bob Dylan and Dizzy Gillespie. The trumpeter, whose actual name was John Birks Gillespie, made a
humorous run for the Presidency in 1964, organizing John Birks Societies in twenty-five states.
Still, the most outlandish of the era's right-wing anti-Communists was not Welch but Willard Cleon Skousen. A
transplanted Canadian who served as a Mormon missionary in his teens, Skousen was considered so radical in the early
nineteen-sixties that even J. Edgar Hoover's F.B.I. watched him closely; one 1962 memo in his extensive F.B.I. file noted
that ""during the past year or so, Skousen has affiliated himself with the extreme right-wing 'professional communists' who
are promoting their own anticommunism for obvious financial purposes."" Skousen was himself employed by the F.B.I.,
from 1935 until 1951, much of that time as a special agent working chiefly in administration. These desk jobs, he claimed
implausibly, gave him access to confidential domestic intelligence about Communism. Skousen also maintained that he
had served as Hoover's administrative assistant; Hoover informed inquirers that there was no such position.
Skousen taught for years in the speech and religion departments at Brigham Young University, interrupted by a stint, from
1956 to 1960, as the police chief of Salt Lake City. His time in office was contentious, and after he raided a friendly card
game attended by the city's right-wing mayor, J. Bracken Lee, he was promptly fired. Lee called Skousen ""a master of half
truths"" and said that he ran the police department ""like a Gestapo""; Skousen's supporters placed burning crosses on the
Mayor's lawn.
After losing his police job, Skousen founded a group called the All-American Society, which Time described in 1961 as an
exemplar of the far-right ""ultras."" Although he did not join the Birch Society, Skousen worked with its American Opinion
Speakers' Bureau, and, in 1963, wrote a rousing tract titled ""The Communist Attack on the John Birch Society,"" which
condemned the society's critics for ""promoting the official Communist Party line."" (This was a tic of Skousen's; he later
defended the Mormon policy of denying the priesthood to blacks with a pamphlet called ""The Communist Attack on the
Mormons."")
All along, Skousen's evolving thoughts ran in tandem with Welch's. In ""The Naked Communist,"" a lengthy primer
published in 1958, he enlivened a survey of the worldwide leftist threat with outlandish claims, writing that F.D.R.'s adviser
Harry Hopkins had treasonously delivered to the Soviets a large supply of uranium, and that the Russians built the first
Sputnik with plans stolen from the United States. A year before Richard Condon's novel ""The Manchurian Candidate""
appeared, Skousen announced that the Communists were creating ""a regimented breed of Pavlovian men whose minds
could be triggered into immediate action by signals from their masters."" A later book, ""The Naked Capitalist,"" decried the
Ivy League Establishment, who, through the Federal Reserve, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Rockefeller
Foundation, formed ""the world's secret power structure."" The conspiracy had begun, Skousen wrote, when reformers like
the wealthy banker Edward M. (Colonel) House, a close adviser to President Woodrow Wilson, helped put into place the
Federal Reserve and the graduated income tax.
In 1971, Skousen organized another group, the Freemen Institute, which he later renamed the National Center for
Constitutional Studies. According to an article published in the Review of Religious Research, the center's targets
included ""the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal
Communication Commission's fairness doctrine in editorial broadcasting, the federal government's change of the gold
standard in currency, all subsidies to farmers, all federal aid to education, all federal social welfare, foreign aid, social
security, elimination of public school prayer and Bible reading, and (that familiar right-wing nemesis) the United Nations.""
Skousen's pronouncements made him a pariah among most conservative activists, including some on the right-wing
fringe. In 1962, the ultraconservative American Security Council threw him out, because members felt that he had ""gone
off the deep end."" In 1971, a review in the Mormon journal Dialogue accused Skousen of ""inventing fantastic ideas and
making inferences that go far beyond the bounds of honest commentary,"" and advancing doctrines that came ""perilously
close"" to Nazism. And in 1979, after Skousen called President.Jimmy Carter a puppet of the Council on Foreign Relations
and the Rockefeller family, the president of the Mormon church issued a national order banning announcements about his
organizations.
Skousen was undeterred. In 1981, he produced ""The 5,000 Year Leap,"" a treatise that assembles selective quotations
and groundless assertions to claim that the U.S. Constitution is rooted not in the Enlightenment but in the Bible, and that
the framers believed in minimal central government. Either proposition would have astounded James Madison, often
described as the guiding spirit behind the Constitution, who rejected state-established religions and, like Alexander
Hamilton, proposed a central government so strong that it could veto state laws. ""The 5,000 Year Leap"" is not a fervid
book. Instead, it is calmly, ingratiatingly misleading. Skousen quotes various eighteenth-century patriots on the evils of
what Samuel Adams, in 1768, called ""the Utopian schemes of leveling,"" which Skousen equates with redistribution of
wealth. But he does not mention the Founders' endorsement of taxing the rich to support the general welfare. Thomas
Jefferson, for example, wrote approvingly in 1811 of having federal taxes (then limited to tariffs) fall solely on the wealthy,
which meant that ""the farmer will see his government supported, his children educated, and the face of his country made
a paradise by the contributions of the rich alone, without his being called on to spend a cent from his earnings.""
Skousen also challenges the separation of church and state, asserting that ""the Founders were not indulging in any idle
gesture when they adopted the motto 'In God We Trust.' ""In reality, the motto that came out of the Constitutional
Convention was ""E Pluribus Unum"": out of many, one. ""In God We Trust"" came much later; its use on coins was first
permitted in 1864, and only in 1955, at the height of the Cold War, did Congress mandate that it appear on all currency.
The following year, President Eisenhower—who Welch charged was a Communist agent—approved ""In God We Trust"" as
the national motto.
In 1982, Skousen published a follow-up work, an ancestor-worshipping history text titled The Making of America,"" and
prepared a study guide for nationwide seminars based on its contents. As Alexander Zaitchik reports in his informative
study of Beck, ""Common Nonsense,"" the new book became an object of controversy in 1987, after the California
Bicentennial Commission sold it as part of a fund-raising drive. Among its offenses was an account of slavery drawn from
long-disgraced work by the historian Fred A. Shannon, which characterized slave children as ""pickaninnies"" and
suggested that the worst victims of slavery were the slaveholders themselves. The constitutional scholar Jack Rakove, of
Stanford, inspected Skousen's book and seminars and pronounced them ""a joke that no self-respecting scholar would
think is worth a warm pitcher of spit.""
By the time Skousen died, in 2006, he was little remembered outside the ranks of the furthest-right Mormons. Then, in
2009, Glenn Beck began touting his work: ""The Naked Communist,"" ""The Naked Capitalist,"" and, especially, ""The 5,000
Year Leap,"" which he called ""essential to understanding why our Founders built this Republic the way they did."" After
Beck put the book in the first spot on his required-reading list—and wrote an enthusiastic new introduction for its reissue—
it shot to the top of the Amazon best-seller list. In the first half of 2009, it sold more than two hundred and fifty thousand
copies. Local branches of the Tea Party Patriots, the United American Tea Party, and other groups across the country
have since organized study groups around it. ""It is time we learn and follow the FREEDOM principles of our Founding
Fathers,"" a United American Tea Party video declares, referring to the principles expounded by Skousen's book. If Beck is
the movement's teacher, ""The 5,000 Year Leap"" has become its primer, with ""The Making of America"" as a kind of 102-
level text.
The popularity of Beck's broadcasts, which now reach two million viewers each day, has brought neo-Birchite ideas to an
audience beyond any that Welch or Skousen might have dreamed of. Several times a week, Beck informs his audience
that socialists (whom he also sometimes calls Fascists or Communists) led by Obama have seized power, and that
patriotic Americans must take their country back. His TV show for some time featured ""Comrade Updates,"" in which Beck
described perfidy while the Soviet anthem played in the background. He attacks all the familiar bogeymen: the Federal
Reserve System (which he asserts is a private conglomerate, unaccountable to the public); the Council on Foreign
Relations (born of a ""progressive idea"" to manipulate the media in order to ""let the masses know what should be done"");
and a historical procession of evildoers, including Skousen's old target Colonel House and Welch's old target Woodrow
Wilson. His sources on these matters, quite apart from Skousen's books, can be unreliable. On September 22nd, amid a
diatribe about House, Beck cited a passage from ""Secrets of the Federal Reserve,"" by Eustace Mullins. The book,
commissioned in 1948 by Ezra Pound, is a startlingly anti-Semitic fantasy of how a Jewish-led conspiracy of all-powerful
bankers established the Federal Reserve in service of their plot to dominate the world.
Part of Beck's allure is the promise that he will reveal secret information. In one segment last year, he produced a drawing
of fasces—which he described, anachronistically, as ""the Roman symbol of Fascism""—and then a picture of an old
Mercury dime, with fasces on the reverse side. ""Who brought this dime in? It happened in 1916—Woodrow Wilson was
the President,"" he said. ""We've been on the road to Fascism for a while."" Benito Mussolini, of course, didn't adopt the
ancient symbol of authority as the Fascist emblem until the nineteen-twenties; the designer of the coin, the sculptor
Adolph A. Weinman, intended it to signify the nation's military preparedness, and paired it with an olive branch to illustrate
the desire for peace.
Beck's readings of Progressive-era politics are nearly as bizarre. Whatever can be said about Theodore Roosevelt, he
was not a crypto-radical. It was Roosevelt who coined the term ""lunatic fringe"" to describe the extreme leftists of his day,
and his concept of New Nationalism—in which an activist government built a vibrant capitalism, partly by regulating big
business—looked back to Alexander Hamilton, not Karl Marx. Nor was Wilson a Bolshevik; in fact, in 1917 he sent
American troops to Russia to support the anti-Bolshevik White Army. At home, his reforms sought to break up monopolies
in order to restore competition among small companies. ""If America is not to have free enterprise,"" Wilson declared, ""then
she can have no freedom of any sort whatever.""
In 2007, Beck, then the host of ""Glenn Beck,"" on CNN's Headline News, brought to his show a John Birch Society
spokesman named Sam Antonio, who warned of a government plot to abolish U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada,
""and eventually all throughout the Americas."" Beck told Antonio, ""When I was growing up, the John Birch Society—I
thought they were a bunch of nuts."" But now, he said, ""you guys are starting to make more and more sense to me."" His
guest beamed. ""Yes, we at the John Birch Society are not nuts,"" Antonio said. ""We are just exposing the truth that's been
out there for many, many years."" Since then, the Birch Society's Web site has run clips from Beck's Fox broadcasts,
proudly pointing out similarities with their own ideas. Last June, an essay on the site described a presentation by Beck on
Communism in America as ""the ultimate in complete agreement between the Beck and JBS presentations of American
history.""
Beck has also praised Ezra Taft Benson, one of Skousen's close associates. Benson, the Secretary of Agriculture under
President Eisenhower and the thirteenth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, gained notoriety for
a speech in 1966 in which he denounced Democratic officeholders and intellectuals (including the historian Arthur M.
Schlesinger, Jr.) as socialists and Communist sympathizers, warned that ""the Constitution will be endangered and hang,
as it were, by a single thread,"" and praised the John Birch Society as ""the most effective non-church organization in our
fight against creeping socialism and Godless Communism."" Last June, Beck aired a clip from another Benson speech,
intoning, ""Ezra Taft Benson warned about what was coming."" The Birch Society's Web site subsequently praised Beck for
""getting progressively (sorry for the bad word choice) closer to presenting American history in the way that The John Birch
Society has been doing it for over 50 years.""
Beck is no more the sole representative of today's multifaceted Tea Party than Welch or Skousen was of the nineteen-
sixties far right; he recently told the Times, a bit disingenuously, that he was ""not involved with the Tea Party."" Why, then,
have the politics of Skousen, Benson, and the John Birch Society had such a resurgence among conservative
Republicans—not just through Beck but through Tea Party heroes like the Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron
Angle? (Last month, Angle gave a warm address to a ""freedom conference"" in Salt Lake City, co-sponsored by the John
Birch Society and Skousen's old group, the National Center for Constitutional Studies, praising her audience as
""mainstream America"" and patriots who had ""heard the call."") The columnist Frank Rich, among others, has suggested
that the election of a black President sowed ""fears of disenfranchisement among a dwindling and threatened minority in
the country."" There are signs that this is so: Republicans' singling out of Thurgood Marshall as an ""activist Justice"" during
Elena Kagan's Supreme Court confirmation hearings, the warnings on Fox News about the terrible dangers posed by the
minuscule New Black Panther Party. But ""socialist"" is not a racial slur. Jim Crow was not built out of fears of the Federal
Reserve and the I.R.S. The Tea Party's fulminations against cap-and-trade, federal-government bailouts, and big
government generally play on very old themes that have nothing to do with the color of President Obama's skin.
The current right-wing resurgence has more to do with the inner dynamics of American conservatism in the past half
century. In the nineteen-fifties and nineteen-sixties, the far right was condemned by liberals, as might be expected; in
November, 1961, President Kennedy devoted part of a speech in Los Angeles to denouncing those ""discordant voices of
extremism"" that ""equate the Democratic Party with the welfare state, the welfare state with socialism, and socialism with
Communism."" But the Bircher right also provoked deep anxiety among conservatives, who feared being perceived as
paranoids and conspiracy-mongers.
The leading intellectual spokesman and organizer of the anti-Bircher conservatives was William F. Buckley, Jr., the editor
of National Review. Buckley was by no means moderate in his conservatism. He was a lifelong defender of Joseph
McCarthy and a foe of New Deal liberalism. But he drew the line at claiming that the course of American government was
set by a socialist conspiracy, and he feared that the ravings of the extreme right would cost more balanced, practical
conservatives their chance at national power. ""By 1961,"" his biographer John B. Judis writes, ""Buckley was beginning to
worry that with the John Birch Society growing so rapidly, the right-wing upsurge in the country would take an ugly, even
Fascist turn rather than leading toward the kind of conservatism National Review had promoted."" In the next two decades,
with Buckley's support and counsel, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan completed a conservative revolution that
succeeded by keeping extremist elements far from the centers of power.
As confidant and adviser to leading conservative politicians, Buckley had far more political influence than might be
expected from the editor of a weekly journal. Yet in the early nineteen-sixties he found fighting the Birchers and their
fellow-travellers extremely difficult. Even though some of Buckley's colleagues at National Review thought that the Birch
Society went too far, they would not attack the society publicly, for fear of alienating both the Birchers and the
conservatives who sympathized with their views. When Buckley wrote an editorial in 1962 that accused Welch of
""distorting reality"" and failing to make ""the crucial moral and political distinction"" between Communists and liberals, the
magazine immediately lost subscriptions and financial support.
By 1960, Senator Barry Goldwater, of Arizona, was emerging as the great political hope of conservative Republicans, and
he consulted closely with Buckley. At a meeting at the Breakers hotel, in Palm Beach, in January, 1962, Buckley urged
Goldwater to repudiate the Birch Society. Goldwater demurred; though he conceded that some embarrassing ""kooks""
lurked among the Birchers, he insisted to Buckley that there were also some ""nice guys,"" and that it would be injudicious
to attack the group in public. The Birchers' support helped gain Goldwater the Republican Presidential nomination in
1964, and he winked at them in his acceptance speech with his famous line: ""Extremism in the defense of liberty is no
vice. . . . Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.""
In the general election, though, Goldwater suffered a crushing loss to Lyndon Johnson, partly because Democrats
succeeded in making him look like a captive of the loony right. (To the Goldwater slogan ""In Your Heart, You Know He's
Right,"" the Democrats shot back, ""In Your Guts, You Know He's Nuts."") Buckley's fears had been confirmed. But he was
undeterred in his efforts to build a respectable and viable conservative movement. In 1967, he favored Richard Nixon
among a field of Republican aspirants. He liked Ronald Reagan's politics, but considered Reagan, who had only recently
been elected the governor of California, too new to national politics. George Romney, the governor of Michigan, a wishy-
washy moderate, was obviously unsuitable, to say nothing of the Republican archliberal Nelson Rockefeller, of New York.
Nixon was a hard-nosed Republican with strong conservative views, especially on Communism and the Cold War; he had
established himself as a Communist-hunter in the nineteen-forties by pressing the charge that Alger Hiss, a former official
at the State Department, had spied for the Soviets. And, promisingly, Nixon was the front-runner. ""It seems to me that we
ought to have a real chance of winning this year,"" Buckley wrote to Goldwater around the time of the Republican National
Convention. He served the campaign as an adviser, and by aiding his friend Frank Shakespeare, who had taken charge
of Nixon's media operations.
But Buckley's candidate had a reputation for shiftiness that made him unpopular across the political spectrum. Some of
the editors of National Review, recalling that Nixon had cut a deal with Rockefeller in order to secure the G.O.P.
nomination in 1960, didn't sufficiently trust him. And the Birch Society had nothing but contempt for the figure whom
Welch had called one of ""the slipperiest politicians that ever showed up on the American scene."" As President, in 1969,
Nixon began to open diplomatic relations with Communist China, and the right wing placed him on its list of perfidious
appeasers. When he visited Beijing in 1972, even Buckley was deeply offended. But when the general election took place
later that year, with the antiwar Democratic candidate, George McGovern, voicing the country's anxieties over Vietnam,
Buckley and the mainstream of what he called ""responsible conservatism"" returned to Nixon. The purist conservatives
were left to back the third-party candidacy of John Schmitz, a Republican congressman and a member of the John Birch
Society.
Nixon won in a landslide, and the next year he appointed Buckley the American delegate to the United Nations. The
conservative pragmatists had found the way to real power. And, despite the embarrassment of Watergate, in Nixon's
second term, their strategy proved effective over time. Nixon's campaign against McGovern sharpened the Democrats'
internal divisions over civil rights and Vietnam, and, Buckley wrote, revealed that the Democrats had ""an indifference
toward national independence and a hostility toward national freedom."" Meanwhile, the Buckley mainstream, having read
the Birchers out of the conservative movement, established itself as a permanent and growing force in the Republican
Party and in national politics.
In 1976, Buckley and National Review supported Ronald Reagan's primary challenge to Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford.
After two terms as governor, Reagan had matured into what Buckley considered a nearly ideal conservative politician: a
shrewd leader as well as a man of principle. Reagan nearly succeeded in wresting the nomination from Ford,
demonstrating how formidable a national figure he had become. The Bircher right had flourished in his political bastion of
Orange County, and Reagan was adept at winning extremists' allegiance while he pursued realistic strategies. His
pragmatic side showed immediately after he finally secured the Republican nomination in 1980, when he chose the
relatively moderate George H. W. Bush, his bitter foe during the primaries, as his running mate. Though the decision
dismayed right-wing ideologues, it had two practical benefits: it instantly healed the divisions between Republican
moderates and conservatives, and it helped dampen charges from the Democrats that Reagan was a reckless right-
winger. Nobody was more pleased by Bush's selection than his fellow Skull and Bones man William F. Buckley, who
understood the political logic as clearly as Reagan had.
As President, Reagan flattered the extremists—he even delivered some admiring words about Skousen's Freemen
Institute—but he saved his political capital for his real goals: undoing the fiscal underpinnings of New Deal-style
government, and redirecting U.S. foreign policy by battling the Soviet Union and its proxies around the world. He
appointed moderates to positions of importance, as when he made James Baker III, Bush's close associate, his first chief
of staff, rather than the far more ideological Edwin Meese III, his former chief of staff from California. (As a top policy
adviser, Meese helped Reagan stack the federal bench with conservatives, but he was otherwise eclipsed by Baker and
Baker's deputy, the pragmatic Reaganite Michael Deaver, and his crusade, as Attorney General, to roll back civil-rights
legislation largely failed.) When zealots in the Administration were exposed, as in the Iran-Contra scandal, Reagan
skillfully evaded responsibility and replaced them with more centrist Republicans. And, when he recognized in Mikhail
Gorbachev a Soviet leader with whom he could undertake genuine efforts to reduce the nuclear threat, Reagan pushed
forward, ignoring the complaints that he had become, in the hard-liner Howard Phillips's phrase, ""a useful idiot for Soviet
propaganda.""
Whatever misgivings may have arisen about him on the right, Reagan achieved a dramatic conservative overhaul of the
federal tax code, a profound reconfiguring of the judiciary, and a near-victory for the West in the Cold War. From the
standpoint of the mainstream right, the only problem with his legacy was that no other Republican could come close to
matching his public appeal and political savvy. For the party of Reagan, his departure was the beginning of a long decline,
and it is the absence of a similarly totemic figure, during the past twenty years, that has allowed the current resurgence of
extremism. George H. W. Bush repelled right-wingers with his moderate tendencies—not least when, in the face of fiscal
calamity, he broke his campaign pledge not to raise taxes. Bill Clinton inspired them to an almost ecstatic series of
attacks, and though there remained enough of an older conservative establishment, personified by Senator Bob Dole, to
check some of the wildest charges, the new Republican House majority after 1994, pushed by such ideologues as Tom
DeLay and Dick Armey, had little interest in maintaining the center. They harassed Clinton, forcing an impeachment even
though polls showed that more than sixty per cent of the American people disapproved. George W. Bush seemed at first
to have a bit of Reagan's conservative charisma, but the right wing turned against him for failing to win the war in Iraq, for
his moderate position on immigration, and for spending hundreds of millions of federal dollars to combat the financial
collapse in 2008. When William F. Buckley died, during the 2008 primary season, it seemed to symbolize the end of a
conservative era. David Klinghoffer, a former literary editor at National Review, lamented that ""urbane visionaries and
builders of institutions"" such as Buckley have been replaced by media figures ""who make their money by stirring fears and
resentments."" Conservatism, Klinghoffer added, ""has undergone a shift toward demagoguery and hucksterism,"" and is
now ruled by those he called ""the crazy-cons.""
Some Republicans have tried to extend the Buckley tradition, but to little effect. The commentator David Frum, a former
speechwriter for George W. Bush, lost his job at the American Enterprise Institute after he complained about the
Republicans' obstruction of health-care reform and called the right-wing surge a threat to conservatism. In June, the
congressman Bob Inglis, of South Carolina, a tough conservative who nonetheless backed Bush's financial bailout, lost a
vicious primary fight with a right-wing insurgent named Trey Gowdy. To his amazement, Inglis was confronted on the
campaign trail by voters who were convinced that numbers on their Social Security cards indicated that a secret bank had
bought them at birth. ""And then, of course,"" he recalls, ""it turned into something about the Federal Reserve and the
Bilderbergers and all that stuff."" Not even Karl Rove can afford open dissent with the Tea Partiers. Appearing on Fox
News the night of the recent primaries, he described the Tea Party-backed Senate candidate in Delaware, Christine
O'Donnell, as probably unelectable and said that some of her statements were ""nutty."" Instantly, criticism came from
Sarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh, and other right-wing Republicans. Within days, he was back on Fox, proclaiming himself ""a
huge Tea Party fan,"" endorsing O'Donnell, and affirming that the National Republican Senatorial Committee would give
her its full backing.
So far, Rove, an unlikely dissident, is the only prominent Republican leader to so much as gesture at stepping forward, as
Buckley and his allies did. Even strong conservatives like Inglis have been pushed aside, as have such former G.O.P.
stalwarts as Charlie Crist, in Florida, and Mike Castle, in Delaware, both beaten in the primaries by Tea Party candidates;
Grist is now running a long-shot campaign as an Independent. Desperate for gains in the midterm elections, the
Republicans are neglecting the struggle it took to make politics safe for Reagan.
Fifty years ago, President Kennedy deplored the far right's ""counsels of fear and suspicion."" Today, Obama's White
House is still struggling to make sense of its enemies. In the absence of forthright leadership, on both the right and the
left, the job of standing up to extremists appears to have been left to the electorate. Candidates like O'Donnell may prove
too eccentric to prevail, or voters may simply become disillusioned by politicians who campaign on their hatred of
government. After the election, mainstream conservatives may well engage in what Richard Viguerie has forecast as ""a
massive, almost historic battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party."" (Already, Rove and some leading Bush
political operatives, including the former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie, have been quietly
supplanting the battered G.O.P. establishment in the effort to raise funds for this year's candidates.) But, according to a
recent poll, more than seventy per cent of Republicans support the Tea Party, and it seems almost certain that a
Republican Party that has unstintingly appeased the far right will enjoy a strong and perhaps smashing victory in the
coming midterm elections.
In 1906, early in the Progressive era, the humorist Finley Peter Dunne's fictional barroom sage, Mr. Dooley, put the social
and political tumult of the day into perspective. ""Th' noise ye hear is not th' first gun iv a revolution,"" Dooley remarked. ""It's
on'y th' people iv th' United States batin' a carpet."" A century from now, or even a year from now, Americans may say the
same about the Tea Party. For the moment, though, it appears that the extreme right wing is on the verge of securing a
degree of power over Congress and the Republican Party that is unprecedented in modern American history. For
defenders of national cohesion and tempered adversity in our politics, it is an alarming state of affairs. •

Why Obama Is Losing the Political War
By Mark Halperin
Barack Obama is being politically crushed in a vise. From above, by elite opinion about his competence. From below, by
mass anger and anxiety over unemployment. And it is too late for him to do anything about this predicament until after
November's elections.
With the exception of core Obama Administration loyalists, most politically engaged elites have reached the same
conclusions: the White House is in over its head, isolated, insular, arrogant and clueless about how to get along with or
persuade members of Congress, the media, the business community or working-class voters. This view is held by Fox
News pundits, executives and anchors at the major old-media outlets, reporters who cover the White House, Democratic
and Republican congressional leaders and governors, many Democratic business people and lawyers who raised big
money for Obama in 2008, and even some members of the Administration just beyond the inner circle. (See Obama's
troubled first year, issue by issue.)
On Friday, after the release of the latest bleak unemployment data — the last major jobs figures before the midterms —
Obama said, ""Putting the American people back to work, expanding opportunity, rebuilding the economic security of the
middle class is the moral and national challenge of our time."" But elites feel the President has failed to meet that challenge
and are convinced he will be unable to do so in the remainder of his term. Moreover, there is a growing perception that
Obama's decisions are causing harm — that businesses are being hurt by the Administration's legislation and that
economic recovery is stalling because of the uncertainty surrounding energy policy, health care, deficits, housing,
immigration and spending.
And that sentiment is spreading. Many members of the general public appear deeply skeptical of Obama's capacity to turn
things around, especially, but not exclusively, those inclined to dislike him — Tea Partyers and John McCain voters, but
also tens of millions of middle-class Americans, including quite a few who turned out for Obama in 2008. (See how some
Americans are facing the prospect of long-term unemployment.)
The misery afflicting the country has no political affiliation. Listen to the voices from this striking TV ad for Rob Portman,
the Republican former Congressman and Bush budget director who is running for Senate from Ohio. One woman at a
Dayton career fair says starkly, ""There are no jobs."" A man announces plaintively and with obvious frustration, ""I've been
looking for a job now for 13 months."" Events like this job fair are becoming the grim iconic gatherings of our time, the
breadlines for the Obama years.
Most of Obama's private (and sometimes public) rebuttals to the voices slamming him on all sides are justified or spot on.
He did inherit a lot of problems from the Bush Administration. He did act quickly in the initial weeks of his Administration to
stave off a worldwide depression. His efforts at job creation have been obstructed by Republicans (even the proposals
based on policies supported by the GOP in the past). His opponents haven't put forth specifics of their own, nor offered
genuine compromise, while the media have allowed the right's activists and gabbers to run wild with criticism without
furnishing legitimate alternative solutions. (See Barack Obama's top 10 sound bites.)
But Obama has exacerbated his political problems not just by failing to enact policies that would have actually turned the
economy around, but also by authorizing a series of tactical moves intended to demonize Republicans and distract from
the problems at hand. He has wasted time lambasting his foes when he should have been putting forth his agenda in a
clear, optimistic fashion, defending the benefits of his key decisions during the past two years (health care and the
Troubled Asset Relief Program, for example) and explaining what he would do with a re-elected Democratic majority to
spur growth.
Throughout the year, we have been treated to Obama-led attacks on George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, Rush Limbaugh,
Congressman Joe Barton (for his odd apology to BP), John Boehner (for seeking the speakership — or was it something
about an ant?) and Fox News (for everything). Suitable Democratic targets in some cases, perhaps, but not worth the time
of a busy Commander in Chief. In the past few days, we have witnessed the spectacle of the President himself and his
top advisers wading into allegations that Republicans are attempting to buy the election using foreign money laundered
through the Chamber of Commerce, combining with Karl Rove and his wealthy backers to fund a flood of negative
television commercials. Not only is this issue convoluted and far-fetched, but it also distracts from the issues voters care
about, frustrating political insiders and alienating struggling citizens (not that many are following such an offbeat story
line). Feinting and gibing can't obscure those job numbers. (See the best viral campaign ads of 2010.)
The President and Democrats have passed many significant measures (the stimulus spending, the auto-company rescue,
the health care law and the financial regulation effort) that someday may be seen as brave and bold, the foundation for a
better economy. Obama and his closest aides certainly think that will happen. But the President was correct when he said
Friday, ""the only piece of economic news that folks still looking for work want to hear is, 'You're hired,"" and that's still not
occurring for too many Americans.
The politically good news for Obama is that no matter what the outcome of the midterm elections, everything changes in
January. Republicans will have a greater obligation, politically and morally, to help govern, rather than thwart and badger.
The President will get a chance, in his State of the Union address and in his budget proposal, to show he is turning the
page on the political horrors of 2010 for his party and the nation. But before then, Republicans are almost certainly going
to demonstrate that you can beat something with nothing, especially when Americans seem to think that the Obama
Administration hasn't much to offer either, except more of the same that isn't working.

Goodbye, Mr. Jones
And good riddance. Why Jim Jones was the worst national
security advisor in decades.
BY DAVID J. ROTHKOPF I OCTOBER 8, 2010
The president's inexperience did in Jones more than any of the general's deficits. He didn't know what he wanted. He
vacillated on key issues. He simply demonstrated the problems America repeatedly has when it hires men with no foreign-
policy background to take on the most important international job in the world. Further, he did not really know enough
about how the presidency works to nip in the bud the creation of the inner-circle bubble that effectively negated much of
the work that the formal policy process did. Obama encouraged (or tolerated for long-enough that it looks like
encouragement) his campaign foreign-policy deputies to continue to report directly to him, and this led to some public and
private backdooring of Jones that undercut his authority dramatically. He did not empower Jones, and that combined with
Jones's own shortcomings led to the zero-chemistry, ineffective collaboration that has been openly criticized by senior
White House and foreign policy officials since the spring of Obama's first year in office.
In fact the situation got so bad that Jones was publicly undercut by true Obama confidante Denis McDonough more than
once. It is something of a surprise he lasted this long. As one former national security advisor said to me while we were
discussing a well-known instance of McDonough publicly undercutting Jones, ""That would have only happened once on
my watch. It would have been me or him."""

The Power Of Clinton, The Invisibility Of
Obama
First Posted: 10-12-10 02:37 PM I Updated: 10-12-10 02:37 PM
LOUISVILLE -- I see that Dr. Rand Paul has taken out after Bill Clinton, dredging up Monica Lewinsky. And I know why
Paul did so. The former president was here in Kentucky yesterday and in this state, as in many others, he is a far more
potent and popular foe than President Barack Obama.
On my first day working for The Huffington Post, I came back to Kentucky, where I began my career many years ago at
the Courier-Journal. The people who run the University of Louisville Kentucky Author Forum wanted me to do an on-stage
interview with a certain best-selling author who is also my new boss: Arianna Huffington. It was a tricky mix of professional
incest and personal nostalgia, but the event worked out well and I also got a chance to play Kentucky reporter once again
out in the state.
I raced over to Lexington and here is the ground-level, outside-the-Beltway reality I witnessed:
Like Voldemort's, Obama's is a name no one dares utter -- and that includes Clinton speaking to Democrats.
At a sunny, noontime rally on the campus of the University of Kentucky in Lexington yesterday, the former president made
a stirring, well-argued case for Democratic Senate candidate Jack Conway and for Democrats generally -- without once
mentioning Obama and rarely mentioning the presidency. It was as though we suddenly had only two branches of
government.
To be fair, almost no one else at the one-hour rally mentioned the sitting president. And Kentucky is staunch Republican
territory. ""We're farther ahead in the generic ballot here than ever,"" GOP Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky told me
yesterday. ""President Obama was never popular here, even at his peak.""
Still, the eerie invisibility of the president is a telling commentary on the Democrats' confused, divided and defensive
predicament as they brace for the verdict of the voters on Election Day, Nov. 2. There was something odd -- and, if you're
a Democrat, depressing -- about a former Democratic president avoiding any mention of his Democratic successor.
Clinton sincerely wants to help out on the trail -- and certainly wants to avoid the accusation that he didn't try to help. But
his travels have turned into a personal victory lap that often makes him -- not the candidate he's touting -- the center of
attention. That was true here in Kentucky. The rally's mechanics were mostly handled by the Secret Service; more to the
point, the final (and therefore top-billed) speaker wasn't Conway. It was Clinton. The Conway people didn't mind. They
were glad to have him.
Rail-thin but not frail, wearing a tweedy professorial sports coat and his signature rueful, knowing smile, Clinton was
treated with a respect bordering on awe. His familiar mane of white hair, thinning now, was translucent in the sun, giving
him an almost otherworldly look: the Sage from a Better Age.
Clinton is beloved In Kentucky. He won the state twice. He speaks the local dialect, which contains Appalachian notes of
working-class pride, suspicion of big shots and Baptist revivalism. But more than that -- and more than just in Kentucky --
Clinton's economic record (22.7 million jobs created, and he tends not to forget to mention the .7) looks spectacularly
good in the context of what has followed.
These days there is almost an Old Testament, milk-and-honey reverence for that economic record, at least as expressed
by former Kentucky Sen. Wendell Ford. An old-school podium pounder, Ford -- stooped but still strong voiced at 86 --
talked of the former president in messianic terms. ""Bill Clinton found us the path to gold!"" he shouted. The crowd of 2,000,
most of them students, didn't laugh. They seemed to think he was right.
How any of this helps Obama is far from clear; it isn't even clear that it helps many Democrats -- since they'd be joining
the same Washington party that the current president ostensibly heads.
But Clinton is all too happy to show Obama how it's done. As a campaigner and as president, Clinton's gift was his ability
to untangle the knots of even the most complex policy issue and explain it in plain language to people suspicious of the
powerful -- but eager not to be screwed by them or to be seen as dupes. Republicans and their corporate allies were out
to shut down the few good things that government does for you, he said, in the name of balancing a budget that they
themselves destroyed. ""I gave you budget surpluses!"" Clinton said, as if this had been an act of personal beneficence.
Knowing his audience, the former president focused on Pell Grants, and on a new program that allows graduates to pay
back their loans over longer periods and at lower rates. Paul, he said, will try to take that new program away -- and, given
the GOP's deliberate vagueness about spending cuts -- there is reason to think Clinton is right.
Which is why Paul got personal today. Which means Clinton drew blood. Which means that he did what he came to do.
Which means Obama will remain invisible, at least in Kentucky, at least for now, and probably for a long time to come.

Thanks for your email. Of course it's not personal. But I do think it's
wrong.
When we were in Government we believed we could only succeed if we treated
Northern Ireland as a bi-partisan issue and I encouraged other Governments
to adopt the same approach. That meant when President Bush was in the White
House, I went out of my way always to see and brief Democrats - in Congress
and in the Senate - whenever I came to the States. It also meant when we
held the first economic conference led by Mayor Bloomberg in Belfast, the
dinner we gave at Hillsborough was not restricted to just those in
respective Governments.
In respect of how we handled the issue within the UK, that didn't mean I
invited the Shadow Secretary of State to share every platform, but the
Shadow was not excluded from being at major events. Indeed we made a point
of not only saying we were bi-partisan, but acted accordingly.
Having brokered the Hillsborough Agreement and having discussed with your
Secretary of State - at all stages - how the US could help through an
Economic Conference, I am obviously somewhat disappointed not to have been
invited to attend the Conference in any capacity.
That of course should never be confused with my deep respect and adMiration
for Secretary Clinton. Frankly without her help during her time in the White
House, as a Senator, as a candidate and now as Secretary, we could never
have made the progress we did. You will know that, at the time, I was always
disappointed that her contribution to the peace process and political
process was not recognized appropriately by the Conservative Party and their
spokesmen when they were in Opposition.
The decision by Owen Patterson to decide not to be present at next week's

stable peace process, but continuing to build cross-party and
cross-community consensus. I am sorry we have not been invited to help.
The current coalition Government in Britain will not always be in power and
it may not even last the course. It seems regrettable that in such a
challenging global economic environment that those of us who helped build
the peace are not even invited to continue helping.
Best,

While there was no independent election observation or monitoring of Burma's November 7 elections, anecdotal and
initial media reports suggest low to medium voter turnout. There were no major incidents that disrupted polling,
according to available information. The United States declined to participate in staged-Government of Burma (GOB) led
""election tours"" as did EU missions. Though all signs point to a full victory for pro-regime parties, the GOB has not
announced election results yet and has not provided any clear indication of when it plans to do so. Opposition and exile
groups claim advance voting schemes are one indication of significant fraud and vote rigging. End Summary."

The Crossroads Nation
By DAVID BROOKS
Bill Clinton used to talk about building a bridge to the 21st century. President Obama talks about laying down a ""new foundation."" But
Clinton was always vague about what the land on the other side of that bridge was going to look like, and Obama is vague about what
edifice is going to go on top of that foundation.
They are vague because nobody is clear about what sort of country America is going to be in 2030 or 2050. Nobody has quite defined
America's coming economic identity.
In thinking about this question, it probably helps to start at the beginning. Five hundred years ago, agriculture was the major economic
activity. One hundred years ago, it was industrial production. Now, of course, we're living in an information age. Innovation and
creativity are the engines of economic growth.
Howard Gardner of Harvard once put together a composite picture of the extraordinarily creative person: She comes from a little place
somewhat removed from the center of power and influence. As an adolescent, she feels herself outgrowing her own small circle. She
moves to a metropolis and finds a group of people who share her passions and interests. She gets involved with a team to create
something amazing.
Then, at some point, she finds her own problem, which is related to and yet different from the problems that concern others in her
group. She breaks off and struggles and finally emerges with some new thing. She brings it back to her circle. It is tested, refined and
improved.
The main point in this composite story is that creativity is not a solitary process. It happens within networks. It happens when talented
people get together, when idea systems and mentalities merge.
Now imagine you are this creative person in the year 2010, 2025 or 2050. You are living in some small town in Ukraine or Kenya or
some other place, foreign or domestic. You long to break out and go to a place where people are gathering to think about the things you
are thinking about, creating the things you want to create.
If you are passionate about fashion, maybe you will go to Paris. If it's engineering, maybe it'll be Germany. But if you are passionate
about many other spheres, I suspect you'll want to be in America.
You'll want to be in the U.S. because English has become the global language. You'll want to come because American universities lead
the world in research and draw many of the best minds from all corners of the earth.
You'll want to be there because American institutions are relatively free from corruption. Intellectual property is protected. Huge
venture capital funds already exist.
Moreover, the United States is a universal nation. There are already people there with connections all over the world. A nation of
immigrants is more permeable than say, Chinese society.
You also observe that America hosts the right kind of networks — ones that are flexible and intense. Study after study suggests that
America is one of those societies with high social trust. Americans build large, efficient organizations that are not bound by the circles of
kinship and clan. Study after study finds that Americans are not hierarchical. American children are raised to challenge their parents.
American underlings are relatively free to challenge their bosses. In this country you're less likely to have to submit to authority.
From this story you can see that economic power in the 21st century is not going to look like economic power in the 20th century. The
crucial fact about the new epoch is that creativity needs hubs. Information networks need junction points. The nation that can make
itself the crossroads to the world will have tremendous economic and political power.
In 2009, Anne-Marie Slaughter, now director of policy planning at the State Department, wrote an essay for Foreign Affairs in which
she laid out the logic of this new situation: ""In a networked world, the issue is no longer relative power, but centrality in an increasingly
dense global web.""
Slaughter's essay was titled ""America's Edge."" That is apt. Americans are now in a depressed state of mind. As China and India rise,
nearly two-thirds of Americans believe their nation is in decline.
In fact, the U.S. is well situated to be the crossroads nation. It is well situated to be the center of global networks and to nurture the right
kinds of networks. Building that America means doing everything possible to thicken connections: finance research to attract scientists;
improve infrastructure to ease travel; fix immigration to funnel talent; reform taxes to attract superstars; make study abroad a rite of
passage for college students; take advantage of the millions of veterans who have served overseas.
The nation with the thickest and most expansive networks will define the age. There's no reason to be pessimistic about that."

House Democrats Plan Schedule
for Lame-Duck Session
By Alan K Ota, CQ Staff
House Democratic leaders on Wednesday outlined a schedule for the
lame-duck session that would have lawmakers in town for at least two
weeks in November and into early December.
Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., assistant to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said in an
interview after a conference call among Democratic leaders that
lawmakers were likely to work through next week, take a week off for the
Thanksgiving recess, and return for a second — and, for now, final —
week from Nov. 29 to Dec. 3.
Van Hollen, who is poised to take over next year as the top Democrat on
the Budget Committee, said he was unsure how Democrats would resolve
disputes over unfinished business such as tax cuts that are set to expire
Dec. 31 and funding for federal programs beyond the stopgap spending
measure (PL 111-242) that expires Dec. 3.
""We simply identified some of the issues that are out there,"" Van Hollen
said of the private leadership chat. ""Obviously, the big issue is how we
deal with various tax issues. And then there's the issue of an omnibus
[spending bill] versus a continuing resolution. There are a lot of other
potential issues. We're going to try to get the nutrition bill.""
He was referring to ongoing talks over a possible extension of expiring
provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts (PL 107-16, PL 108-27), the
debate over whether to move an omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2011 or
another temporary spending measure, and a stalled child nutrition bill (HR
5504).
Van Hollen said that Pelosi, D-Calif., did not bring up the issue of the
tough caucus race for minority whip — the second-ranking Democrat in
the next Congress — between Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland and James E.
Clyburn of South Carolina. Both men were on the telephone call, Van
Hollen said, but the issue did not come up.
Democratic aides said Pelosi has encouraged both men to reach a
settlement to avert the potentially bloody intraparty fight. ""That wasn't
part of the discussion,"" Van Hollen said."

Jackson Diehl Editorial
Madame Secretary, as we understood on Wednesday, our conscious decision not to mention domestic Egyptian issues
publicly was noticed at the Post editorial board. I had multiple exchanges with Jackson over the course of the day
yesterday. Based on your colloquy with Aboul-Gheit and Jeff s follow-up, we are quoted in the piece which you see in
the clips as having a direct and spirited exchange with the Egyptians and that there was no misunderstanding of the
importance that we attach to these issues. So in the end Jackson grants some credit for the discussion, and we agree to
disagree on the degree to which this discussion should be public.

Catty Carla Bruni lifts lid on Michelle Obama's
'hellish' job
By Peter Allen and Michael Seamark
Last updated at 1:26 AM on 16th September 2010
Michelle Obama thinks being America's First Lady is 'hell', Carla Bruni reveals today in a wildly indiscreet new book.
Miss Bruni reveals that Mrs Obama replied when asked about her position as the U.S. president's wife: 'Don't ask! It's
hell. I can't stand it!'
Details of the private conversation, which took place at the White House during an official visit by Nicolas Sarkozy last
March, emer ed in Carla And The Ambitious, a book written in collaboration with Miss Bruni.
No secrets: Michelle Obama, left, and Carla Bruni last year. Bruni made the revelations about the U.S. First Lady's
feelings in a wildly indiscreet new book
In it, she says one term as French president `will be enough' for her husband and suggests he might take tips from his
friend Tony Blair: Why not start making money?'
More...
• France hits back at EU after accusations Sarkozy government acted 'like Nazis' in treatment of Roma
According to a friend quoted in the book, the Sarkozys have been 'impressed and inspired' by Mr Blair's fortune built up
since he left Downing Street.
Miss Bruni also takes a thinly veiled swipe at Princess Diana when talking about a visit to an African hospital full of Aids
victims earlier this year.
She says she refused requests by French cameramen for a photograph of her carrying a baby in her arms 'like Lady Di',
adding: 'There's something obscene in promoting yourself when you are giving of yourself.'

In the book, the Italian model 42, accuses French government officials of trying to 'kill' her husband with too much work,
and claims Mr Sarkozy lets himself be 'bullied' into complying.
Comparing herself to other leaders' wives, Miss Bruni says: 'I'm so different. I was a model. I sing, and I want to continue
to sing. And on top of that you expect me to be subtle?' And she admits: 'I am a femme fatale, my dear.'
She also recounts a telephone row with Mr Sarkozy's ex-wife Cecilia, who warned her that Mr Sarkozy had 'not yet turned
a new page' after their marriage.
Miss Bruni replied: 'Not only has he turned a page but he's changed books altogether. And you are the only person on
earth not to have noticed it.'

The rise of the Tea Party movement in the United States in the first twenty months of Barack Obama '5 presidency is
shaking the political establishment, a trend reinforced by the victories of its candidates in Republican Party primaries. But
where has the movement come from, and what is its inner life? Max Blumenthal
begin_of the_skype highlighting end of the_skype highlighting, author of ""Republican Gomorrah"", enters the heady
world of the Tea Party to unravel the mix of driven personalities, feverish rhetoric, toxic hatreds, and flirtation with violence
that fuel its sub-culture's insurgent activism.
""He will tell you that he wants a strong authority to take from him the crushing responsibility of thinking for himself. Since
the Republic is weak, he is led to break the law out of love for obedience. But is it really strong authority that he wishes?
In reality he demands rigorous order for others, and for himself disorder without responsibility"" - Jean-Paul Sartre, Anti-
Semite and Jew
I am not sure when I first detected the noxious fumes that would envelop the conservative movement in the Barack
Obama era. It might have been in April 2009, when I visited a series of gun shows in rural California and Nevada.
Perusing tables piled high with high-calibre semi-automatic weapons and chatting with anyone in my vicinity, I heard
urgent warnings of mass roundups, concentration-camps, and a socialist government in Washington. ""These people that
are purchasing these guns are people that are worried about what's going on in this country"", a gun dealer told me outside
a show in Reno. ""Good luck Obama"", a young gun enthusiast remarked to me. ""We outnumber him 100 to 1."" At this time,
the Tea Party movement had not even registered on the national media's radar.
In September 2009, I led a panel discussion at the University of California-Riverside about my book Republic Gomorrah
(Basic/Nation Books, 2009). Inside an auditorium filled with nearly 100 students and faculty, I sat alongside Jonathan
Walton, an African-American professor of religious studies and prolific writer, and Mark Takano, an erudite, openly gay
former Democratic congressional candidate and local community-college trustee. In the middle of our discussion, a dozen
college Republicans stormed the front of the stage with signs denouncing me as a ""left-wing hack"" while a hysterical
young man leaped from the crowd, blowing kisses mockingly at Takano while heckling Walton as a ""racist"". Afterward,
university police-officers insisted on escorting me to my ride after the right-wing heckler attempted to follow me as he
shouted threats.
Who was this stalker? Just a concerned citizen worried about taxes? His name was Ryan Sorba and he was an operative
of a heavily funded national conservative youth outfit, the Intercollegiate Studies Institute. Besides founding dozens of
Republican youth groups across the country, Sorba has devoted an exceptional amount of energy to his interest in
homosexuals. His intellectual output consists of a tract titled The Born Gay Hoax, arguing that homosexuality is at once a
curable disease and a bogus trend manufactured by academic leftists. Adding to his credentials, Sorba has a history of
run-ins with the law, he explained when I called him about the order.
My encounter with this aggressive right-wing cadre seemed a strange, isolated event. But the hostility turned out to be
symptomatic of the intensifying campaign to delegitimise President Obama and his allies in Congress. The right's days of
rage were only beginning.
The constellation
Through his first year in office, Obama seemed oblivious to the threat of the far right. He campaigned against
partisanship, declaring that there were ""no red states"" and no ""conservative America"". Apparently, he thought it was
merely a contrivance or myth that there were people who rejected science, demonised gays, assailed minority and
women's rights - not that they genuinely believed in what they said. Speaking of changing Washington, Obama seemed to
think that the entire history of politics since the rise of Ronald Reagan and the right and their strategies of polarisation was
not deeply rooted but a superficial problem attributable to certain ""divisive"" personalities, easily wiped away with gestures
toward bipartisanship. His view of the parties was that they were simply mirror images sharing fundamental beliefs but
separated by ""partisans"". The skilled and devoted community organiser could bring them together.
Many of his supporters in the media, often partisans of political wars over the years, reinforced and amplified his
innocence, proclaiming he was the one at last who could ""bridge the partisan divide"". Andrew Sullivan, a disaffected
conservative who once called critics of George W Bush policies ""fifth columnists"" but now fervently supported Obama,
wrote that the new president was destined to become ""a liberal Reagan who can reunite America"". This optimism
pervaded the White House as the new president and his aides sought out Republicans willing to vote for his programmes.
After all, why couldn't we all just get along?
In his autobiographical book The Audacity of Hope, Obama highlighted a key component of his political strategy: ""I serve
as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views."" Once he was elected,
conservatives concluded that they could reverse Obama's strength by transforming him into a human tableau for the most
fearsome images they could conjure (see ""Barack Obama, the fallen messiah"", 23 December 2009).
Obama's multiracial background was crucial in cultivating resentment among the shock-troops. Those who rejected
Obama's legitimacy to serve as president on the basis of his background gave birth to the ""Birther"" movement that sought
to challenge his citizenship. The movement's most visible figure, and therefore the most eccentric, was Orly Taitz, a
dentist and self-trained lawyer who had immigrated from the former Soviet republican of Moldova to Israel before settling
in the conservative bastion of Orange County, California. Convinced by claims on the far-right website WorldNetDaily that
Obama planned to create a ""civilian national security force"", Taitz told me she ""realised that Obama was another Stalin -
it's a cross between Stalinist USSR and Hitler's Germany.""
After becoming transfixed by online conspiracy theories claiming Obama's family had forged his birth-certificate in Hawaii,
Taitz snapped into action. She filed a lawsuit in November 2008 with California's secretary of state Debra Bowen
demanding an investigation into Obama's eligibility to serve as president. Taitz's plaintiff in the case was Wiley Drake, an
Orange County radio-preacher and former second vice-president of the Southern Baptist Convention who once publicly
prayed for Obama's death. While her lawsuit went nowhere, and subsequent suits earned her angry rebukes from judges,
Taitz became an instant media sensation, delivering heavily accented screeds against Obama before friendly interviewers
from Sean Hannity to CNN's Lou Dobbs (the latter, described by Taitz as her ""greatest supporter"", was eventually fired as
an indirect result of his hosting of her).
In March 2009, the Texas Representative Randy Neugebauer signed on to a Birther bill proposing that future presidential
candidates must prove their citizenship before becoming eligible to campaign. The Birther movement had found its voice
in government and made an indelible impact on the Republican grassroots. By June 2009, 28% of Republican
respondents to a Kos/Research 2000 poll said they thought Obama wasn't born in the United States, while 30% ""weren't
sure"". ""Obama should be in the Big House"", Taitz shrieked to me, ""not the White House!""
When Obama announced healthcare reform as the first major initiative of his administration, the conservative movement
activated a campaign of demonisation - transformational politics - designed to turn Obama into the ""Other"", making him
seem as unfamiliar, and therefore as threatening, as possible. When the president urged the Congress to deliver a
healthcare-reform bill in 2009, the right staged a living theatre of political hatred which turned Obama's dream of
bipartisanship into a nightmarish version of Peter Weiss's MaraVSade. On 12 September 2009, tens of thousands of far-
right activists belonging to a loose confederation of anti-government groups called the Tea Party Patriots converged on
Washington's National Mall for a giant protest against the Obama healthcare plan. The date was significant: Fox News's
top-ranked talk-show host Glenn Beck had declared the birth of the ""9-12 Project"" to restore the sense of unity (and siege
mentality) that Americans experienced on 11 September 2001. But this time, Obama - not Osama - was the enemy.
While covering the rally, I witnessed sign after sign declaring Obama a greater danger to America's security than al-Qaida;
demonstrators held images that juxtaposed Obama's face with images of evildoers from Hitler to Pol Pot to Bin Laden;
others carried signs questioning Obama's status as a United States citizen. ""We can fight al-Qaida, we can't kill Obama"",
said an aging demonstrator. Another told me, ""Obama is the biggest Nazi in the world"", pointing to placards he had
fashioned depicting Obama and House of Representatives' majority leader Nancy Pelosi in SS outfits. According to
another activist, Obama's agenda was similar to Hitler's: ""Hitler took over the banking industry, did he not? And Hitler had
his own personal secret service police. [The community-organising group] Acorn is an extension of that.""
The seemingly incongruous Tea Party propaganda recalled signs waved by right-wing Jewish settlers during rallies
against Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and his support of the peace process, portraying him as an SS officer and as
the French collaborator Marshall Petain. In 1995, amid this provocative atmosphere, a young right-wing Jewish zealot
assassinated Rabin. The Israeli tragedy was a cautionary example of targeted hatred leading to violence.
Members of the Tea Party ""Patriots"" did not seem to care that their rhetoric was irrational, or that comparing Obama to
Hitler and Stalin was contradictory and obviously hyperbolic. Their motives were entirely negative. By purging government
of the multicultural evil that had seized power through illicit means (several activists told me they believed Acorn helped
Obama steal the election), they were convinced that a mythical golden American yesteryear would return. They had no
interest in building anything new or even articulating an agenda, much less discussing the merits of policies. The Tea
Party's primary concern was cultural purification - freedom from, not freedom to. Against the dark image of the president
and his liberal allies, Tea Party activists defined themselves as the children of light. The racial subtext was always
transparent.
The Tea Party's strategy rested on a guerrilla campaign of chaos and sabotage designed not only to intimidate Democrats
but also to disorient independent voters who might have supported healthcare reform. The Tea Paters were convinced
this would be an easy feat, since they believed the majority of the country was on their side - that they represented the
""real America"". At the 9-12 rally Matt Kibbe, one of the march organisers, told the crowd that ABC News was reporting
that 1 million to 1.5 million people were in attendance; ABC denied this, saying ""ABCNews.com reported an approximate
figure of 60,000 to 70,000 protesters."" Then one Dick Armey led the crowd in a chant of ""Freedom works! Freedom
works!"" Unknown to most of the Tea Paters, they were intoning the name of a corporate-funded Beltway advocacy-
group, not the battle-cry of Mel Gibson's version of William Wallace in Bra veheart.
Indeed, contrary to its image as a grassroots movement mobilised to stifle the machinations of Washington elites, the Tea
Party movement was the creation of a constellation of industry-funded conservative groups with close Republican ties.
The movement's leading puppet-master was the same Dick Armey, who directed resources and talking-points to the Tea
Party ""Patriots"" from his Washington-based advocacy group, FreedomWorks. Among the corporate clients of Armey's
lobbying firm, which he was forced to leave as a result of his involvement in the Tea Parties, was the pharmaceutical giant
Bristol Myers Squibb, a company with a clear interest in defeating healthcare reform. (Armey's other ""real American""
clients included the Marxist terror-cult, the People's Mojahedin of Iran, which received funding and assistance from
Saddam Hussein in order to launch terrorist strikes throughout the 1990s against Iranian civilian targets.) Armey collected
a consulting fee of $250,000 directly from FreedomWorks and $300,000 from allied astroturf front groups. FreedomWorks
paid out much of its money to an assortment of Republican political consultants.
The rumour
If Dick Armey was the Tea Party king, Sarah Palin was eager to be crowned the Tea Party queen. Just days after
Obama's inauguration, Palin abruptly quit her job as Alaskan governor to vie for the honour. Palin's motives for quitting
became clear when she inked a lucrative deal to write her political memoir Going Rogue, signed on as a regular
contributor to Fox News, and received $1 million an episode for a reality-show on cable television, ""Sarah Palin's Alaska"".
Palin's book-tour, which sent her through Middle America in a luxuriously outfitted bus, resembled both a presidential
campaign and a travelling carnival.
Whether or not Palin intends to run for president, her growing media presence has magnified her influence within the
Republican Party. Yet the ever-expanding Palin phenomenon was greeted with hostility by Republican politicos
desperately seeking to expand the party's base after the drubbing in 2008. Steve Schmidt, formerly John McCain's
campaign manager in the doomed presidential campaign of 2008, warned that Palin's nomination in 2012 would be
""catastrophic"" for the GOP. His doomsday prediction was backed by an Gallup poll in October 2009 revealing her as one
of the most polarising and unpopular political figures in the country with a disapproval rating of over 50%. Unfortunately for
Schmidt and other party pragmatists, those who approve of Palin represent the heartbeat of the Republican Party, its
most fervent activists, and cannot be dissuaded from following her, even if she is leading the party off a cliff.
A special congressional election in New York's heavily Republican 23rd district in November 2009 was the first major test
of Palin's power. Along with a parade of nationally recognised conservatives, Palin endorsed Doug Hoffman, an unknown
far-right third-party candidate closely allied with the Tea Party - in the process helping to force a popular moderate
Republican politician, Dede Scozzafava, from the race. In the end, Palin's ideological purge in upstate New York led to an
improbable Democratic victory, the first in that district in more than 100 years. After the disaster Palin and her allies
claimed victory, insisting they had at least hastened the purge of ideologically impure Republicans from the party. She
went on to endorse Rand Paul, the son of right-wing libertarian Representative Ron Paul and a candidate in Kentucky's
GOP senatorial primary; meanwhile George W Bush's vice-president Dick Cheney went out of his way to endorse Rand's
regular Republican opponent, Trey Grayson, the Kentucky secretary of state.
The self-described ""hardcore pro-lifer"" Palin followed the Tea Party script of avoiding social issues like abortion and gay
marriage in order to obscure the large presence of the Christian right within the movement's ranks, recasting herself
accordingly as a libertarian concerned primarily with issues of ""economic freedom"". She claimed the Democratic ""cap-
and-trade"" plan to limit carbon-emissions would harm the livelihood of blue-collar workers, and she assailed healthcare
reform as a Trojan horse for ""socialism"" (though she admitted her family ""used to hustle over the border"" to take
advantage of Canada's single-payer healthcare system). But no Palin attack had as much effect as the one she blasted
out on her Facebook page claiming the Obama healthcare plan included a provision for ""death panels"" that would
recommend euthanasia for severely ill patients like her Down syndrome-afflicted son, Trig. With the click of a button, Palin
transformed the tone of the healthcare debate from rancorous to poisonous.
The source of Palin's ""death panels"" smear was a practiced propagandist, former New York's lieutenant governor Betsy
McCaughey. When Bill Clinton introduced healthcare reform during his first term as president, McCaughey falsely claimed
in an article published in the New Republic that the plan would force consumers to drop their private plans and buy into
the government's programme (the article, widely circulated by Republicans, would go on to win a National Magazine
Award, only to be retracted years later by the New Republic's editors). Now she was back in the spotlight, pushing a
rumour that would be voted by the non-partisan fact-checking website Politifact.com as ""the lie of 2009"". McCaughey's
latest innuendo was boosted by the cult of political crank Lyndon LaRouche, which mobilised to push the rumour into the
mainstream.
In June 2009, one of LaRouche's top lieutenants publicly confronted Ezekiel Emanuel, the National Institute of Health's
chief bioethicist and brother of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, accusing him of seeking to reintroduce Hitler's
T-4 programme to kill the handicapped through healthcare reform. ""President Obama has put in place a reform apparatus
reviving the euthanasia of Hitler Germany in 1939, that began the genocide there"", LaRouche staffer Anton Chaitkin
charged. Soon, LaRouche's followers were on street corners around the country with posters depicting Obama with a
Hitler moustache. At a townhall forum on healthcare reform hosted by Barney Frank, a Democratic Representative, a
LaRouche follower waved one of the Obama-as-Hitler posters and demanded: ""Why do you continue to support a Nazi
policy, as Obama has expressly supported this policy?""
Two months later, after Palin whispered the rumour on Facebook, prominent conservatives from former House speaker
Newt Gingrich to ranking Senate finance-committee member Charles Grassley, parroted her claims before audiences of
indignant Tea Paters. Not to be outdone, Glenn Beck devoted an extended rant on his show to the reality of death
panels. Beck, echoing the LaRouche cultists, accused Ezekiel Emanuel of ""the devaluing of human life, putting a price on
each individual."" He thundered, ""The death panel is not a firing-squad. Rationing is inevitable and they know it!""
The death-panel rumour served a variety of functions, all useful to the movement, but not necessarily to the Republican
Party. Most importantly, the rumour resonated both with hard-core libertarians who resented the very existence of the
federal government and Christian right activists who viewed the legalisation of abortion as a slippery-slope to government-
sponsored euthanasia. The hysteria it engendered helped repair the rift exposed by the Terri Schiavo charade in 2005,
when the evangelical conservative James Dobson publicly clashed with Armey, the libertarian leader, over the right of the
government to interfere in a private family matter of life and death.
The enemy
The slurring of Obama as a sort of sleeper-agent crypto-Muslim helped bring the neo-conservatives back into the fray.
The new neocon generation was led by Dick Cheney's daughter, Liz, who founded an anti-Obama advocacy group, Keep
America Safe, by leveraging donations from pro-Israel sources. Asked by CNN's Larry King about the Birther movement
that was challenging Obama's status as an American citizen, Liz Cheney remarked: ""One of the reasons you see people
so concerned about this is people are uncomfortable with having for the first time ever, I think, a president who seems so
reluctant to defend the nation overseas."" With the libertarians, Christian right, and the neocons seated around the same
table, united in resentment of the alien president, the conservative movement was whole again.
The experiments in ""terror-management theory"" developed by three professors of psychology (Sheldon Solomon of
Skidmore College, Jeff Greenberg of the University of Arizona, and Tom Pyszczynski of the University of Colorado) have
demonstrated the connection between fear of death and intensification of conservative attitudes. The findings help explain
the effectiveness of the death-panel rumour and insinuations by conservative figures that Obama was not truly American
and somehow sympathetic to Islamic terrorists. Indeed, these seemingly irrational smears were guided by tactical
reasoning, calculated to agitate voters with constant reminders of their own mortality. Whether or not independent voters
responded, the rhetoric of death kept the Tea Party crowd in a persistent state of panic and rage, ensuring a standing
army ready to fan out to rallies and town halls at the first sign of liberal malfeasance.
Obama's first year in office was marked by more than raucous protests; there were several disturbing murders committed
by far-right extremists. In April 2009, a 22-year-old neo-Nazi wannabe named Richard Poplawsi mowed down a Swat
team of Pittsburgh cops, killing three. Poplawski's best friend told reporters the young killer ""grew angry recently over
fears Obama would outlaw guns."" Later it was discovered that Poplawski had posted a video-clip to a neo-Nazi website
portraying Fox's Glenn Beck contemplating the existence of concentration-camps. (After a characteristically thorough
investigation, Beck conceded they were not real.) On another occasion, the killer posted a video promoting Tea Party
rallies. A month after the Pittsburgh bloodbath, Scott Roeder, a supporter of the militant anti-abortion group Operation
Rescue, shot Dr George Tiller to death while he prayed at his church in Wichita, Kansas. Tiller was declared fair game by
the anti-abortion movement because of his role as Kansas's only late-term abortion provider. During at least twenty-eight
episodes of Bill O'Reilly's ""O'Reilly Factor,"" O'Reilly had referred to Tiller as ""Tiller the baby killer"", a criminal guilty of
""Nazi stuff."" ""I wouldn't want to be [Tiller] if there is a Judgment Day"", O'Reilly proclaimed.
In August 2009, a middle-aged professional named George Sodini walked into a health club in suburban Pittsburgh and
gunned down three women. The major media outlets explained Sodini's motives away by homing in on passages in his
online diaries describing his loneliness, inability to convince women to have sex with him, and descent into chronic
masturbation. Nearly every publication omitted or ignored a long deranged entry in which Sodini projected his sexual
frustration onto Obama, whom he seemed to view as a symbol of black male virility and predation.
The day after Obama's election victory, Sodini wrote: ""Good luck to Obama! He will be successful. The liberal media
LOVES him. Amerika has chosen The Black Man. Good! In light of this I got ideas outside of Obama's plans for the
economy and such. Here it is: Every black man should get a young white girl ... Kinda a reverse indentured servitude
thing. Every daddy know when he sends his little girl to college, she be ... real good. I saw it. 'Not my little girl', daddy
says! (Yeah right!!) Black dudes have thier [sic] choice of best white?? [ellipses in original].""
In another posting to an anti-Clinton forum in 1994, during the height of the Republicans' Whitewater investigation, Sodini
revealed that he had purchased a bumper-sticker reading, ""Stop Socialism, Impeach Clinton,"" from a National Review ad.
A year later, Sodini ranted on an anti-government militia site: ""I am convinced that more drastic action is required to bring
the country back to the Constitutional order that it was 200 years ago. I don't think any group of political leaders will
achieve this for us."" Whether or not Sodini's murder-spree was motivated by his political passions, he was pathologically
death-driven and fixated on the phantasmagoria of right-wing imagery. In his final diary entry, Sodini proclaimed: ""Death
lives!""
The bible
More than any other media figure of the Obama era, Glenn Beck encouraged the campaign of racial demonisation and
conspiracy that consumed the Tea Party ""Patriots"". During a broadcast of ""Fox and Friends"", Beck opined that Obama
""has exposed himself over and over and over again as a guy who has a deep-seated hatred for white people, or the white
culture."" As evidence, Beck pointed to White House green-jobs czar Van Jones, an African-American former community
organiser who was eventually forced to resign as a direct result of Beck's crusade. From there, Beck targeted another
black Obama adviser, Valerie Jarrett, highlighting her ties to Acorn while upholding her and Jones as evidence of
Obama's ""socialist"" agenda. In another broadcast, Beck played an audio clip of unidentified African-Americans referring to
""Obama money"" as they collected welfare-cheques in Detroit. Then he showed footage of members of a Kansas City-
based youth group practicing a step show, a traditional African-American group dance apparently unfamiliar enough to
Beck and his transfixed audience that he felt at liberty to claim the footage as evidence that ""Obama's SS"" was being
trained across inner-city America.
In September 2009, Beck relentlessly targeted Acorn, the rights new favourite hobgoblin, admitting that he intended to
use the poor people's advocacy group to distract his viewers from the healthcare debate. ""Trust me"", Beck said,
""Everybody now says they're going to be talking about healthcare. I don't think so."" (His statement was reminiscent of
Rush Limbaugh's scandal-mongering remark during the early Clinton administration: ""Whitewater is about healthcare."")
Beck promptly cued up a series of hidden-camera videos shot by conservative youth activists James O'Keefe and Hannah
Giles inside Acorn field offices.
In the videos, O'Keefe baited African-American staffers into making statements explaining that Giles, who claimed she
was a prostitute, could obtain low-income housing. O'Keefe edited in images of himself clad in an outlandish pimp
costume to create the impression that he was dressed that way during the meetings with Acorn; however, Giles later
admitted her partner had lied about wearing his costume to further incriminate Acorn. In the end, Acorn was exonerated of
all criminal wrongdoing.
In a separate incident O'Keefe was arrested and charged with a federal crime after he and several conservative pals
disguised themselves as telephone repairmen and attempted to wiretap phone-lines in the office of Senator Mary
Landrieu of Louisiana. Like Ryan Sorba, O'Keefe and his posse were movement cadres paid and directed by well-funded
conservative outfits; O'Keefe had been trained by the Leadership Institute, the right-wing youth group that nurtured
leading lights like Jack Abramoff, Karl Rove, Ralph Reed, and Jeff Gannon.
While O'Keefe and his buddies plea-bargained with prosecutors, Beck basked in his formula for success. His show earned
the highest ratings at Fox News, topping network franchises like O'Reilly and Sean Hannity. In the process, Beck's
opinions became firmly implanted in the nervous systems of Tea Party activists. ""Glenn Beck has taught us everything we
know"", a demonstrator at the 9-12 rally told me. ""He's opened our eyes to so much.""
But unlike the right-wing radio warhorses who helped usher in Newt Gingrich's Republican counter-revolution of 1994,
Beck was not an authentic product of the movement. When Rush Limbaugh first began dominating the AM airwaves,
Beck was mired in the world of mid-level commercial radio, delivering corny yarns about lesbians and celebrity trash in
hopes of becoming the next Howard Stern. By night, as he has tirelessly recounted, he medicated his anxiety with cocaine
and alcohol, destroying his first marriage in the process. ""We remember Glenn from the womanising, the drinking, the
drugs. Everybody who knew him at the time saw what a complete mess he was"", a shock- jock from Tampa, Florida, who
called himself Bubba the Love Sponge remarked to me during a broadcast of his nationally syndicated show.
Like Dusty Rhodes, the pseudo-populist demagogue of Elia Kazan's 1957 film, A Face in the Crowd, Beck was a self-
destructive drifter who might have been crumpled up with a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 in an alleyway or been locked away
in a prison cell had fame not found him first. Beck was only able to stabilise his life when he made his escape from
freedom, marrying a conservative Mormon, converting to her religion, and transmuting his urge to abuse drugs into
conservative radio diatribes.
,When Beck first broke into television on CNN's Headline News Channel, he struggled to articulate a coherent political
worldview. If he distinguished himself from other big-time conservative hosts in any way, he did so through strained and
often snide attempts at humour, remnants of his failed radio career. Nevertheless, with help from his liberal agent,
Matthew Hiltzik, Beck snagged a primetime slot at Fox News in early 2009. Around this same time, Beck began promoting
the work of an arcane Mormon conspiracy-peddler named W Cleon Skousen, whom he described as his political lodestar.
Suddenly, Beck had something more to offer than irritable mental gestures.
Thanks to Beck's designation of Skousen's pseudo-historical tract The 5000 Year Leap as ""required reading"" on the
website of his 9-12 Project, and his promotion of the book on his show, the previously obscure Skousen became the
Hidden Imam of the Tea Party movement. By summer 2009, Skousen's Leap was among the top ten books on Amazon
and a fixture on literature tables at Tea Party gatherings. It went from selling a puny couple of thousand copies in 2007 to
selling over 200,000 copies in 2009. Just why the book generated such an instant appeal is difficult to understand. It is
little more than a slapdash of quotes from the Founding Fathers, often taken out of context and deliberately oversimplified,
to explain why America is the greatest nation in history. In the process, Skousen claims that church and state separation
is un-American, that ""coercive taxation"" is communist, and that marriage is the underpinning of a free society. Benjamin
Franklin, who wrote at length on the merits of ""amours"" with ""old women,"" and who famously solicited prostitutes and
fathered a son of out of wedlock, was the ultimate authority Skousen quoted on the importance of marriage.
Though Skousen claims the Founders as the world's foremost source of eternal wisdom, he buttressed his points with
fringe sources like the conspiracist Norman Dodd's screeds about the Illuminati. According to Skousen, Dodd claimed that
""powerful influences congregating in the United States"" like the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds had forced the United
States into the first world war. Skousen published Dodd's manifestoes in his obscure journal Freemen's Digest, which he
founded for the express purpose of propagating conspiracies.
Skousen's paranoid politics were an outgrowth of his participation in extreme anti-communist groups during the 1950s. He
boasted of a close friendship with then-FBI director J Edgar Hoover and said he provided him with research on communist
plots, claims disputed by FBI historians. (During a recent interview, Skousen's son, Paul, told me that contrary to rumours
of Hoover's cross-dressing and homosexual dalliances, he would set the top cop up on blind dates with live women.)
Skousen was fired from his job as Salt Lake City's police chief for, in the words of the city's conservative Mormon mayor,
""conduct[ing] his office as chief of police in exactly the same manner in which the communists operate their government.""
From there, Skousen sailed off to the far shores of the right-peddling conspiracy tracts like The Naked Communist, and
earning condemnation from his beloved FBI, which accused him in an internal memo of ""promoting [his] own anti-
communism for obvious financial purposes.""
Skousen's vocal support for the far-right John Birch Society's claim that communists controlled President Dwight
Eisenhower cost him the support of the corporate backers who had paid for his Red-bashing lecture tours. He went off the
radar for several years, returning during the late 1960s to accuse the Jewish Rothschild family of secretly bankrolling
everyone from Ho Chi Minh to the civil-rights movement. By the late 1970s, even the Church of Latter-Day Saints
distanced itself from Skousen and his conspiracy theories. His work fell through the margins and might have disappeared
entirely had Beck not revived it, turning The 5000 Year Leap into the bible of the Tea Party movement. Alexander Zaitchik
observed in his authoritative profile of Skousen on Salon that Skousen's renewed influence through Beck and the Tea
Party ""suggests that the modern base of the Republican Party is headed to a very strange place.""
The descent
Besides influencing Beck, Skousen's teachings inspired one of the Tea Party movement's most visible grassroots
celebrities, retired sheriff Richard Mack. I met Mack in February at a far-right rally just outside of Montgomery, Alabama.
On a makeshift stage towed into the middle of a rodeo arena by a pickup truck, Mack recalled with reverence his
mentorship by Skousen, who he said taught him everything he needed to know about the constitution. Mack urged his
spellbound audience to stockpile ammo and store food. ""If you control the food supply"", Mack warned, ""you control the
people. And that's the first step to slavery.""
Already a hero to conservatives for successfully suing the Clinton administration over the provision in the Brady Handgun
Violence Prevention Act requiring law enforcement to conduct criminal-background checks of gun purchasers, Mack
reemerged in the Obama era as the archetypal local lawman who vowed to resist the tyrannical federal government.
Along with a few dozen former and active military and law-enforcement personnel, Mack helped form a self-styled Tea
Party militia called the Oathkeepers. Galvanised by their fear of creeping socialism, the Oathkeepers solemnly swore to
refuse tyrannical federal orders such as cooperating with foreign troops and forcing Americans into concentration-camps.
Because the group's members trained for combat, the vow came with suggestion of armed resistance.
Besides Mack, the Oathkeepers attracted a coterie of militia-movement retreads into its ranks. The most well-established
figure was Mike Vanderboegh, a longtime militia fanatic who published a booklet in the mid-1990s entitled Strategy and
Tactics fora Militia Civil War, calling for sniper attacks on ""war criminals, secret policemen, rats."" With Obama in office,
Vandeboegh churned out anti-government screeds on right-wing blogs with renewed passion and supported his efforts by
cashing in the $1,300 in federal disability compensation he received each month.
For all the energy the far right exerted in its campaign to strangle Obama's agenda, it was a Democrat who posed the
greatest threat to the passage of healthcare reform. Representative Bart Stupak of Michigan had been in office since
1993, placing him among the senior leadership of the so-called centrist Blue Dog Democrats. When healthcare reform
was introduced in Congress, Stupak became the leader of an informal caucus of anti-abortion Democrats, making him the
de facto swing vote on the House version of the bill. By extension, Stupak was the point man in the campaign to ensure
that the bill would not allow federal funding for abortion for low-income women.
But after close consultation with leaders of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, Stupak went a step further. He
introduced a draconian amendment to block women from paying for abortions from even their own private insurance
plans. The amendment, which passed the House but was shut down in the Senate, became a key sticking point in
healthcare negotiations. ""He's a big hero now in the pro-life community"", Deal Hudson - former Catholic issues adviser to
George W Bush - told me in November 2009. ""Thanks to him, this is the first time I can remember the pro-life Democrats
having any power.""
To the chagrin of the Republicans, Stupak entertained offers of compromise from the Democratic leadership. According to
Hudson, the Catholic bishops were keen to see healthcare reform pass, but only if the bill contained a clear provision
forbidding patients from spending federal money on abortion. Finally, in March 2010, after pressure from Nancy Pelosi,
Obama agreed to sign an executive order forbidding the federal funding of abortion. Stupak had been mollified. Now he
and his anti-abortion caucus pledged to deliver the swing votes the Democrats needed to pass the bill. As soon as reports
seeped out declaring the imminent passage of healthcare reform, major right-wing blogs like RedState.org churned out
virulent denunciations of Stupak, calling him a traitor and sellout. The blog comment sections filled up with dozens of
diatribes referring to Stupak in language previously reserved for Dr George Tiller: ""Bart the Baby-Killer.""
On 20 March 2010, thousands of Tea Party activists surrounded the Capitol's Longworth Building in expectation of
Obama's pep talk to the House Democrats and the healthcare vote. Democratic Representative John Lewis, a hero of the
civil-rights movement, and Representative Barney Frank, the first openly gay member of Congress, passed through the
crowd on their way inside the Capitol. ""Nigger!"" a demonstrator barked at Lewis. Another called Frank a ""faggot"", eliciting
laughter and cheers from nearby protesters. Meanwhile, as another African-American Democrat, Representative Emanuel
Cleaver, ascended the Capitol steps, a protester who had been screaming at Lewis and Frank spat on his face.
With the demonstration carried on into the night, cries of ""Kill the bill!"" drifted into calls for violence. ""I would gladly stand
with any of you men here and take these fascists down"", a man in camouflage battle-dress uniform proclaimed in front of
an amateur videographer, pointing toward the Capitol. ""You haven't heard the last of me!""
The next day, Republican members of Congress emerged from the Longworth Building to salute the Tea Paters. The
demonstrators cheered wildly for their proxies on the inside. Finally, after hours of impassioned speeches on the House
floor, the bill passed. But the drama was hardly over.
Republican Representative Joe Pitts, an anti-abortion Catholic who co-authored Stupak's original amendment, demanded
a motion to bring it back to the floor for a vote, a transparent exercise in grandstanding that was certain to fail. In
response, Stupak rushed to the podium with a stinging rebuke to Pitts and the Republicans. ""The motion to commit does
not support life"", Stupak declared. ""It is the Democrats who have stood up...."" Heckling from the Republican side
interrupted his statement. As Stupak looked around the House chamber, Representative Randy Neugebauer, a right-wing
Republican from Texas who openly supported the Birther movement, began shouting at him from the backbench, ""Baby
killer!"" Other Republicans joined in, parroting base insults.
While the Republicans sank their heads in defeat, some more militant devotees of the Tea Party movement called for a
right-wing Kristallnacht. ""If you wish to send a message that Pelosi and her party cannot fail to hear, break their windows"",
Vanderboegh of the Oathkeepers wrote on a far-right blog hours after the bill passed. ""Break them NOW. Break them and
run to break again."" Within three days, windows and doors at Democratic Party headquarters in New York, Kansas and
Arizona had been shattered.
Meanwhile, at least ten Democratic members of Congress reported receiving death threats. Images of nooses were faxed
to the offices of Stupak and James Clyburn, an African-American congressman from South Carolina. Representative
Anthony Weiner, an especially vocal proponent of healthcare reform, received a menacing letter filled with white powder.
The brother of Representative Tom Perriello, another healthcare supporter, had his home gas line deliberately sabotaged
after a local Tea Party organiser posted his address online (he had meant to post the congressman's) and encouraged
activists to ""drop by"" to express their anger about Perriello's recent vote. In Tucson, Arizona, the windows of Democratic
Representative Gabrielle Giffords' office were shattered by shots from a pellet gun. And a brick was thrown through the
window of Representative Louise Slaughter's office in New York as her voicemail filled with threats of impending sniper
attacks.
After the passage of the healthcare bill, the Tea Party floated into a grey zone between authoritarianism and anarchy.
Crusading to restore a holy social order, they promoted disorder. Claiming to protect democracy, they smashed windows
of elected representatives. Warning of death panels, they called in death threats. With the atmosphere of violence
thickening, Palin took to her Twitter account to issue a battle-cry: ""Don't Retreat, Instead-RELOAD!"" Thus concluded the
first phase of the Obama era that was to usher in a peaceable kingdom of bipartisanship."

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
Release of Aung San Suu Kyl
Today I join with billions of people around the world to welcome the long-overdue release of Burmese democracy leader
and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest.
Aung San Suu Kyi has endured enormous personal sacrifice in her peaceful struggle to bring democracy and human
rights to Burma, including unjustified detention for most of the past twenty years. The Burmese regime has repeatedly
rejected her offers to engage in dialogue and work together, trying instead to silence and isolate her. Through it all,
Aung San Suu Kyi's commitment to the Burmese people has not wavered.
The United States calls on Burma's leaders to ensure that Aung San Suu Kyi's release is unconditional so that she may
travel, associate with her fellow citizens, express her views, and participate in political activities without restriction. They
should also immediately and unconditionally release all of Burma's 2,100 political prisoners.
We urge Burma's leaders to break from their repressive policies and begin an inclusive dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi
and other democratic and ethnic leaders towards national reconciliation and a more peaceful, prosperous, and
democratic future.

Moments of imperial and economic decline
-- according to a recent poll, 65% of
Americans now believe this country to be
""in a state of decline"" -- can also be periods
of cultishness, even of madness
incarnate. Such a mood now seems to be
spreading through the United States. It's
not so surprising, really: Since the attacks
of September 11, 2001, fear has
been iniiecttcl into this ""homeland"" like a
drug and a penumbia of official secrecy has
settled over the land in a way that makes
the secrecy of the Cold War years (when
this country faced a superpower, not a
ragtag set offihadis, guerrillas, and
terrorists) seem like an era of sunshine.
In an atmosphere of swirling fears and
hysteria amid declining living conditions,
""explanations"" that at other times might
have remained confined to tiny crews of
conspiracy-mongers can suddenly gain a
patina of plausibility and so traction. No
wonder then that, as hard times hit, as the
financial system seemed on the verge of
collapse, as unemployment soared and a
massive wave of home foreclosures swept
into view, increasing numbers of
Americans became prey to any wacky
explanation for our troubles, none more so
than the idea that Islam was somehow
responsible, that mosques and Islamic
centers meant for a sliver of a minority here
were capable of imposing anything, no less
a way of life on this country, or that Sharia
law (of all things) might somehow worm
its way into state teal systems, or that
YouTube was a hotbed of.terrorism worthy
of suppression, or... well, you name it.
Max Blumenthal, author of the bestselling
book Reptblican Gomorrah: Inside the
Movement Thai Shattered the Party, has
done the necessary legwork to""take us deep
into one of those crews of conspiracy-
mongers who, at another time, just about
no one would have paid much attention to,
but in twenty-first-century America have
gained a remarkable audience. They are a
chilling barometer of the changing weather

the country. With it has
Gone an outburst of arson
attacks on mosques,

prospect existed). This
campaign of islamophobia
wounded President Oba.ma

false rumors about his secret
Muslim faith. And it may
have tainted views of
Muslims in general; an
August 2010 Pew Research

among Americans, the

Muslims had dropped by 11
points since 2005.
Erupting so many years after
the September 11th trauma,
this spasm of anti-Muslim
bigotry might seem oddly

again: it's the fruit of an
organized, long-term

only attained critical mass
during the Obama era. It
was then that embittered
conservative forces, voted
out of power in 2008, sought
with remarkable success to
leverage cultural resentment
into political and partisan
gain.
This network is obsessively
fixated on the supposed
spread of Muslim influence
in America. Its apparatus
spans continents, extending
from Tea Party activists here
to the European far right. It
brings together in common
cause right-wing ultra-
Zionists, Christian
evangelicals, and racist
British soccer hooligans. It
reflects an aggressively pro-
Israel sensibility, with its
key figures venerating the
Jewish state as a Middle
Eastern Fort Apache on the
front lines of the Global
War on Terror and urging
the U.S. and various
European powers to emulate
its heavy-handed methods.
Little of recent American
Jslamophobia (with a.strong
emphasis on the ""phobia"") is
sheer happenstance. Years
before Tea Party shock
troops massed for angry
protests outside the
proposed site of an Islamic
community center in lower
Manhattan, representatives
of the Israel lobby and the
Jewish-American
establishment launched a
campaign against pro-
Palestinian campus activism
that would prove a seedbed
for everything to come. That
campaign quickly -- and
perhaps predictably --
morphed into a series of
crusades against mosques
and islarilic schools which,
in turn, attracted an
assortment of shady but
exceptionally energetic
militants into the network's
ranks.
Besides providing the initial
energy for the islamophobic
crusade, conservative
elements from within the
pro-Israel lobby bankrolled
the network's apparatus,
enabling it to influence the
national debate. One
philanthropist in particular
has provided the
beneficence to propel the
campaign ahead. He is a
little-known Los Angeles-
area software security
entrepreneur named Aubrey
Chernick, who operates out
of a security consulting firm
blandly named the National
Center for Crisis and
Continuity Coordination. A
former trustee of the
Washington Institute for
Near East Policy, which has
served as a think tank for the
American Israeli Public
Affairs Committee
(AIPAC), a frontline
lobbying group for Israel,
Chernick is said to be worth
$750 million.
Chemick's fortune is puny
compared to that of the
billionaire Koch Brothers,
extraction industry titans
who fund Tea Party-related
groups like Americans for
Prosperity, and it is dwarfed
by the financial empire of
Haim Saban, the Israeli-
American media baron who
is one of the largest.-orivate
donors to the Democratic
party and recently matched
$9 million raised for the
Friends of the Israeli
Defense Forces in a single
night. However, by injecting
his money into a small but
influential constellation of
groups and individuals with
a narrow agenda. Chernick
has had a considerable
impact.
Through the Fairtmook
Foundation, a private entity
he and his wife Joyce
control, Chernick has
provided funding to groups
ranging from the Anti-
Defamation League (ADL)
and CAMERA, a right-
wing, pro-Israel, media-
watchdog outfit, to violent
Israeli settlers living on
Palestinian lands and figures
like the pseudo-academic
author Robert Spencer, who
is largely responsible for
popularizing conspiracy
theories about the coming
conquest of the West by
Muslim fanatics seeking to
establish a worldwide
caliphate. Together, these
groups spread hysteria about
Muslims into Middle
American communities
where immigrants from the
Middle East have recently
settled, and they watched
with glee as likely
Republican presidential
frontrunners from Mike
Huckabee to Sarah Palin
pmmoted their cause and
oarpe.ki their tropes.
Perhaps the only thing more
surprising than the
increasingly widespread
appeal of islamophobia is
that, just a few years ago,
the phenomenon was
confined to a few college
campuses and an inner city
neighborhood, and that it
seemed like a fleeting fad
that would soon pass from
the American political
landscape.
Birth of a Network
The fslamophobic crusade
was launched in earnest at
the peak of George W.
Bush's prestige when the
neoconservatives and their
allies were riding high. In
2003, three years after the
collapse of President Bill
Clinton's attempt to resolve
the Israeli-Palestinian issue
and in the immediate wake
of the invasion of Iraq, a
network of Jewish groups,
ranging from ADL and the.
American Jewish
Committee to AIPAC,
gathered to address what
they saw as a sudden rise in
pro-Palestinian activism on
college campuses
nationwide. That meeting
gave birth to the David
Project, a campus advocacy
group led by Charles Peters,
who had co-founded
CAMERA, one of the many
outfits bankrolled by
Chernick. With the help of
public relations
professionals,. Peters
ci a plan to ""take
back the campus by
influencing public opinion
through lectures. the
Internet, and coalitions,"" as
a memo produced at the
time by the consulting firm
McKinsey and Company
stated.
In 2004, after conferring
with Martin Kramer, a
fellow at the Washington
Institute for Near East
Policy, the pro-Israel think
tank Where Chernoff had
served as a trustee, Peters
produced a documentary
film that he called Columbia
""rbecornint., It was -filled
with claims from Jewish
students at Columbia
University claiming they
had endured intimidation
and insults from Arab
professors. The film
portrayed that New York
City school's Department of
Middle East and Asian
Languages and Cultures as a
hothouse of anti-Semitism.
In their complaints, the
students focused on one
figure in particular: Joseph
.vlassa.d, a Palestinian
professor of Middle East
studies. He was known for
his passionate advocacy of
the formation of a binational
state between Israel and
Palestine, as well as for his
strident criticism of what he
termed ""the racist character
of Israel."" The film
identified him as ""one of the
most dangerous intellectuals
on campus,"" while he was
featured as a crucial villain
in The Professors: The 101
Most Dangerous Academics
in America, a book by the
(Chemick-•funded)
neoconservative activist
David Horowitz. As
Massad was seeking tenure
at the time, he was
especially vulnerable to this
sort of wholesale assault.
When the controversy over
Massad's views intensified,
Congressman Anthony
Weiner, a liberal New York
Democrat who pqee
:lescri himself as a
representative of ""the ZOA
[Zionist Organization of
America] wing of the
Democratic Party,""
demanded that Columbia
President Lee Bollinger,
a
renowned First Amendment
scholar, fire the professor.
Bollinger responded by
issuing uncharacteristically
defensive statements about
the ""limited"" nature of
academic freedom.
In the end, however, none of
the charges stuck. Indeed,
the testimonies in the David
Project film were eventually
either discredited or never
corroborated. In 2009,
Massad earned tenure after
winning Columbia's
prestigious Lionel Trilling
Award for excellence in
scholarship.
Having demonstrated its
ability to intimidate faculty
members and even powerful
university administrators,
however, Kramer claimed a
moral victory in the name of
his project, boasting to the
press that ""this is a turning
point."" While the David
Project subsequently
fostered chapters on
campuses nationwide, its
director set out on a
different path -- initially,
into the streets of Boston in
2004 to oppose the
construction of the Islamic
Society of Boston Cultural
Center.
For nearly 15 years, the
Islamic Society of Boston
had sought to build the
center in the heart of
Roxbury, the city's largest
black neighborhood, to
serve its sizable Muslim
population. With
endorsements from Mayor
Thomas Menino and leading
Massachusetts lawmakers,
the mosque's construction
seemed like a fait accompli -
- until, that is, the Rupert
Murdoch-owned Boston
Herald and his local Fox
News affiliate snapped into
action. Boston Globe
columnist Jeff Jacoby also
chimed in with a series of
reports claiming the center's
plans were evidence of a
Saudi Arabian plot to bolster
the influence of radical
Islam in the United States,
and possibly even to train
underground terror cells.
It was at this point that the
David Project entered the
fray, convening elements of
the local pro-Israel
community in the Boston
area to seek strategies to
torpedo the project.
According to emqiis
obtained by the Islamic
Society's lawyers in a
lawsuit against the David
Project, the organizers
settled on a campaign of
years of nuisance lawsuits,
along with accusations that
the center had received
foreign finding from ""the
Wahhabi movement in
Saudi Arabia or... the
Moslem Brotherhood.""
In response, a grassroots
coalition of liberal Jews
initiat4d inter-faith efforts
aimed at ending a
controversy that had
essentially been
manufactured out of thin air
and was corroding relations
between the Jewish and
Muslim communities in the
city. Peters would not,
however, relent. 'We are
more concerned now than
we have ever been about a
Saudi influence of local
mosques,"" he ,apounced at
a suburban Boston
synagogue in 2007.
After paying out millions of
dollars in legal bills and
enduring countless smears,
the Islamic Society of
Boston completed the
construction of its
community center in 2008.
Meanwhile, not surprisingly,
nothing came of the David
Project's dark warnings. As
Boston-area National Public
Radio reporter Philip Martin
reflected in September 2010,
""The horror stories that
preceded [the center's]
development seem shrill and
histrionic in retrospect.""
The Network Expands
This second failed campaign
was, in the end, more about
movement building than
success, no less national
security. The local crusade
established an effective
blueprint for generating
hysteria against the
establishment of Islamic
centers and mosques across
the country, while
galvanizing a cast of
characters who would form
an anti-Muslim network
which would gain attention
and success in the years to
come.
In 2007, these figures
coalesced into a proto-
movement that launched a
new crusade, this time
targeting. the Khalil Gibran
International Academy, a
secular Arabic-English
elementary school in
Brooklyn, New York.
Calling their ad hoc pressure
group, Stop the Madrassah
madrassah being simply
the Arab word for ""school"" -
- the coalition's activists
included an array of
previously unknown zealots
who made no attempt to
disguise their extreme views
when it came to Islam as a
religion, as well as Muslims
in America. Their stated
goal was to challenge the
school's establishment on
the basis of its violation of
the church-state separation
in the U.S.
Constitution. The true aim
of the coalition, however,
was transparent: to pressure
the city's leadership to adopt
an antagonistic posture
towards the local Muslim
community.
The activists zeroed in on
the school's principal,
Debbie Almontaser, a
veteran educator of Yemeni
descent, and baselessly
.branded her ""a jihadist"" as
well as a 9/11 denier. They
also accused her of-- as
Pamela Geller, a far-right
blogger just then gaining
prominence put it,
""whitewash[ing] the
genocide against the
Jews."" Daniel Pipes, a
neoconservative academic
previously active in the
campaigns against Joseph
Massad and the Boston
Islamic center (and whose
pro-Likud think tank,
Middle East .Forum, has
received $150,000 from
Chernick) Jamed the
school should not go ahead
because ""Arabic-language
instruction is inevitably
laden with Pan-Arabist and
Islamist baggage."" As the
campaign reached a fever
pitch, Almontaser reported
that members of the
coalition were actually
stallsinQ her wherever she
went.
Given what Columbia
Journalism School professor
and former New York Times
reporter Samuel Freedman
called ""her clear, public
record of interfaith activism
and outreach,"" including
work with the New York
Police Department and the
Anti-Defamation League
after the September 11th
attacks, the assault on
.Almontaser seemed little
short of bizarre -- until her
assailants discovered a
photograph of a T-shirt
produced by AWAAM, a
local Arab feminist
organization, that read
""Intifada NYC."" As it
turned out, AWAAM
sometimes shared office
space with a Yemeni-
American association on
which Almontaser served as
a board member. Though
the connection seemed like a
stretch, it promoted the line
of attack the Stop the
Madrassah coalition had
been seeking.
Having found a way to
wedge the emotional issue
of the Israel-Palestine
conflict into a. previously
New York-centered
campaign, the school's
opponents next gained a
platform at the Murdoch-
owned New York Post,
where reporters Chuck
Bennett and Jana Winter
claimed her T-shirt was
""apparently a call for a
Gaza-style uprising in the
Big Apple."" While
Almontaser attempted to
explain to the Post's
reporters that she rejected
terrorism„ the Anti-
Defamation League chimed.
in on cue. ADL spokesman
Oren Segal told the Post:
""The T-shirt is a reflection
of a movement that
increasingly lauds violence
against Israelis instead of
rejecting it. That is
disturbing.""
Before any Qassam rockets
could be launched from
Almontaser's school, her
former ally New York
Mayor Michael Bloomberg
caved to the growing
pressure and threatened to
shut down the school,
prompting her to resign. A
Jewish principal who spoke
no Arabic replaced
Almontaser, who later filed
a lawsuit against the city for
breaching her free speech
rights. In 2010, the Equal
Employment Opportunity
Commission ui that New
York's Department of
Education had ""succumbed
to the very bias that the
creation of the school was
intended to dispel"" by firing
Almontaser and urged it pay
her $300,000 in damages.
The commission also
concluded that the Post had
quoted her misleadingly.
Though it failed to stop the
establishment of the Khalil
Gibran Academy,•the
burg:eoning anti-M sliin
movement succeeded in
forcing city leaders to bend
to its will, and having
learned just how to do that,
then moved on in search of
more high-profile targets.
As the ,New York Times
s!..t_..at the time, ""The
fight against the school...
was only an early skirmish
in a broader, national
struggle.""
s a battle that has really
just begun."" Pipes told the
Times.
From Scam to Publicity
Coup
Pipes couldn't have been
more on the mark. In late
2009, the Isiamophobes
sprang into action again
when the Cordoba Initiative,
a non-profit Muslim group
headed by Feisai Abdul
Rauf, an exceedingly
moderate Sufi Muslim imam
who regularly
lepic,,etiting the
United States at the behest
of the State Department,
announced that it was going
to build a community center
in downtown New ""NCork
City. With the help of
investors, Raufs Cordoba
Initiative purchased space
two blocks from Ground
Zero in Manhattan. The
space was to contain a
prayer area as part of a large
community center that
would be open to everyone
in the neighborhood.
None of these facts mattered
to Pamela Geller. Thanks to
constant prodding at her
Nog, Atlas Shrugged. Geller
made Cordoba's
construction plans a national
issue, provokino fervent
calls faml conservatives to
protect the ""hallowed
ground"" of 9/11 from
creeping Sharia. (That the
""mosque"" would have been
out of sight of Ground Zero
and that the neighborhood
was, in fact.
everything from strip clubs
to fast-food joints didn't
matter.) Geller's activism
against Cordoba House
earned the 52-year-old full-
time blogger the attention
she apparently craved.,
including a • 1 in
the Neu, York ThIleS and
frequent cable news spots,
esoeciallv, of course, on Fox
News.
Mainstream reporters tended
to focus on Geller's bizarre
stunts. She posted a video
of herself
in a string bikini on a Fort
Lauderdale beach, for
instance, while ranting about
""left-tards"" and ""Nazi
Hezbollah."" Her gall for
boycotting Campbell's Soup
because the company
offered halal -- approved
under Islamic law (as kosher
food is under Jewish law) --
versions of its products got
her much attention, as did
her .cron-lotior of a screed
claiming that President
Barack Obama was the
illegitimate lovechild of
Malcolm X.
Geller had never earned a
living as a journalist. She
supported herself with
millions of dollars in a
divorce settlement and life
insurance money from her
ex-husband. He died in
2008, a year after being
for an alleged $1.3
million scam he was
accused of-running out of a
car dealership he co-owned
with Geller. Independently
wealthy and with time on
her hands, Geller proved
able indeed when it came to
exploiting her strange media
stardom to in.cite the already
organized political network
of islamophobes to intensify
their crusade.
She also benefited from
close alliances with leading
islamophobes from Europe.
Among Ocher's allies was
Andrew Gravers, a Danish
activist who formed the
group Stop the
Islamicization of Europe,
and :.1a.-ye it the unusually
blunt motto: ""Racism is the
lowest form of human
stupidity, but Islamophobia
is the height of common
sense."" Gravers' group
inspired Geller's own U.S.-
based outfit, Stop the
Islamicization of America,
which she formed with her
friend Robert Spencer, a
pseudo-scholar whose
bestselling books, including
The Truth About
Muhammad, Founder of the
World's Most Intolerant
Religion, prompted former
advisor to President Richard
Nixon and Muslim activist
Robert Crane to ca/1
""the principal leader... in
the new academic .field of
Muslim bashing.""
(According to the website
almost $1 million
in donations from Chernick
has been steered to
Spencer's Jihad Watch
group through David
Horowitz's Freedom
Center.)
Perfect sources for
Republican political figures
in search of the next hot-
button cause, their rhetoric
found its way into the
talking points of Newt
Gingrich and Sarah Patin as
they propelled the crusade
against Cordoba House into
the national spotlight.
Gingrich soon pared the
community center to a Nazi
sign next to the Holocaust
Memorial Museum, while
Patin called it ""a stab in the
heart"" of ""the Heartland.""
Meanwhile, Tea Party
candidates like Republican
Ilario Pantano, an Iraq war
veteran who killed two
unarmed Iraqi civilians,
shooting them 60 times -- he
even stopped to reload
made their opppsition to
Cordoba House the
centerpiece of midterm
congressional campaigns
conducted hundreds of miles
from Ground Zero.
Geller's campaign against
""the mosque at Ground
Zero"" gained an unexpected
assist and a veneer of
legitimacy from established
Jewish leaders like Anti-
Defamation League
National Director Abraham
Foxman. ""Survivors of the
Holocaust are entitled to
feelings that are irrational,""
he et.:narked to the New
York Times. Comparing the
bereaved family members of
9-1 1 victims to Holocaust
survivors, Foxman insisted,
""Their anguish entitles them
to positions that others
would categorize as
irrational or bigoted.""
Soon enough, David Harris,
director of the (Chernick-
funded) American Jewish
Committee, was demanding
that Cordoba's leaders be
compelled to reveal their
""true attitudes"" about
Palestinian militant groups
before construction on the
center was initiated. Rabbi
Marvin Hier of the Simon
Wiesenthal Center of Los
Angeles, another major
Jewish group, insisted it
would be ""insensitive"" for
Cordoba to build near ""a
cemetery,"" though his
organization had recently
been granted permission
from the municipality of
Jerusalem to build a
""museum of tolerance"" to be
called The Center for
Human Dignity directly on
top of the Mamilla
Cemetery, a Muslim
Graveyard that contained
thousands of grave sites
dating back 1,200 years.
Inspiration from Israel
It was evident from the
involvement of figures like
Gravers that the
Islamophobic network in the
United States represented a
trans-Atlantic expansion of
simmering resentment in
Europe. There, the far-right
was storming to victories in
parliamentary elections
across the continent in part
by appealing to the
simmering anti-Muslim
sentiments of voters in rural
and working-class
communities. The extent of
the collaboration between
European and American
Islamophobes has only
continued to grow with
Geller, Spencer, and even
Gingrich standing beside
Europe's most prominent
anti-Muslim figure, Dutch
pad iamentarian Geed
Wilders, at a rally against
Cordoba House. In the
meantime. Geller was
issuing statements of
sunport for the Emdish
Defense League, a band of
uoorlstruc[ed riec)-Nazis
and former members of the
whites-only British National
Party who intimidate
Muslims in the streets of
cities like Birmingham and
London.
In addition, the trans-
Atlantic Islamophobic
crusade has stretched into
Israel, a country that has
come to symbolize the
network's fight against the
Muslim menace. As Geller
told the New York Times'
Alan Feuer, Israel is ""a very
good guide because, like I
said, in the war between the
civilized man and the
savage, you side with the
civilized man.""
EDL members regularly
wave Israeli flags at their
rallies, while Wilders claims
to have formed his views
about Muslims during the
time he worked on an Israeli
cooperative farm in the
1980s. He has, he says,
visited the country more
than 40 times since to meet
with rightist political allies
like Aryeh Eldad, a member
of the Israeli Knesset and
leader of the far right
Hatikvah faction of the
National Union Party. He
has called for forcibly
""transferring"" the
Palestinians living in Israel
and the occupied West Bank
to Jordan and Egypt. On
December 5th, for example,
Wilders traveled to Israel for
a 'ffrjend nieei,imr, with
Foreign Minister Avi2clor
Lieberman, then declared at
a press conference that
Israel should annex the West
Bank and set up a
Palestinian state in Jordan.
In the apocalyptic clash of
civilizations the global anti-
Muslim network has sought
to incite, tiny armed Jewish
settlements like Yitzar,
located on the hills above
the occupied Palestinian city
of Nablus, represent front-
line fortresses. Inside
Yitzar's state-funded
yeshiva, a rabbi named
Yitzhak Shapira has
instructed students in what
rules must be applied when
considering killing non-
Jews. Shapira summarized
his opinions in a widely
publicized book. Torat
HaMelech, or The King's
Torah. Claiming that non-
Jews are ""uncompassionate
by nature,"" Shapira cited
rabbinical texts to declare
that gentiles could be killed
in order to ""curb their evil
inclinations."" ""There is
justification,"" the rabbi
proclaimed, ""for killing
babies if it is clear that they
will grow up to harm us, and,
in such a situation they' may
be harmed deliberately, and
not only during combat with
adults.""
In 2006, the rabbi was
briefly held by Israeli police
for urging his supporters to
murder all Palestinians over
the age of 13. Two years
later, according to the Israeli
newspaper Ilaaretz, he
a rabbinical letter in
support of Israeli Jews who
had brutally assaulted two
Arab youths on the country's
Holocaust Remembrance
Day. That same year,
Shapira was arrested as a
suspect in helping
a rocket attack
against a Palestinian village
near Nablus.
Though he was not charged,
his name came up again in
connection with another act
of terror when, in January
2010, the Israeli police
raided his settlement
seeking vandals who had set
fire to a nearby mosque.
One of Shapira's followers,
an American immigrant,
Jack _Mite"", has confessed to
murdering two innocent
Palestinians and attempting
to the kill the liberal Israeli
historian Ze'ev Sternhell
with a mail bomb.
What does all this have to
do with Islamophobic
campaigns in the United
States? A great deal,
actually. Through New
York-based tax-exempt non-
profits like the Central Fund
of Israel and Ateret
Cohenim, for instance, the
omnipresent Aubrey
Chernick has sent tens of
thousands of dollars to
support the Yitzar
settlement, as well as to the
messianic settlers dedicated
to ""Judaizing"" East
Jerusalem. The settlement
movement's leading online
news magazine. Arutz
Sheva, has feattired Geller
as a columnist. A friend of
Geller's, Beth Gili.nsky, a
right-wing activist with a
group called the Coalition to
Honor Ground Zero and the
founder of the Jewish
Action Alliance (apparently
ttun. out of a Manhattan real
estate office), organized a
large rally in New York City
in April 2010 to protest the
Obama administration's call
for a settlement freeze.
Among Chemick's major
funding recipients is a
supposedly ""apolitical""
group called Aish. Hatorah
that claims to educate Jews
about their heritage. Based
in New York and active in
the fever swamps of
northern West Bank
settlements near Yitzar,
Aish Hatorah shares an
address and staff with a
shadowy foreign non-profit
called the Clarion Fund.
During the 2008 U.S.
election campaign, the
Clarion Fund distributed 28
million DVDs of a
propaganda film called
Obsession as newspaper
inserts to residents of swing
states around the country.
The film featured a who's
who of anti-Muslim
activists, including \Valid
Shoebat, a self-proclaimed
""former PLO terrorist.""
Among Shoebat's more
striking statements: ""A
secular dogma like Nazism
is less dangerous than is
Islamofascism today."" At a
Christian gathering in 2007,
this ""former Islamic
terrorist"" told the crowd that
Islam was a ""satanic cult""
and that he had been born
again as an evangelical
Christian. In 2008, however,
the Jerusalem Post, a right-
leaning newspaper, exposed
h rn as a fraud, whose
claims to terrorism were
fictional.
Islamophobic groups
registered only a minimal
impact during the 2008
election campaign. Two
years later, however, after
the Republicans regained
control of the House of
Representatives in midterm
elections, the network
appears to have reached.
critical mass. Of course, the
deciding factor in the
election was the economy,
and in two years, Americans
will likely vote their
pocketbooks again. But that
the construction of a single
Islamic community center or
the imaginary threat of
Sharia law were issues at all
reflected the influence of a
small band of locally
oriented activists, and
suggested that when a
certain presidential
candidate who has already
been demonized as a crypto-
Muslim runs for reelection,
the country's most vocal
Islamophobes could once
again find a national
platform amid the frenzied
atmosphere of the campaign.
By now, the Islamophobic
crusade has gone beyond the
right-wing pro-Israel
activists, cyber-bigots, and
ambitious hucksters who
conceived it. It now belongs
to leading Republican
presidential candidates, top-
rated cable news hosts, and
crowds of Tea Party
activists. As the fervor
spreads, the crusaders are
basking in the glory of what
they accomplished. ""I didn't
choose this moment,"" Geller
mused to the New York
Times, ""this moment chose
me.""

in play (Corker, Chamblis, Cochran, McCain and Murkowski). Moreover, there are bound to be some ""sleepers"" as the
vp called them. This could be Roberts, Crapo, Kirk or others.
We have a meeting in the morning with Kerry, Lugar and Kyl to discuss the remaining amendments. Reid is encouraging
Kerry to offer to vote on a handful of R amendments post cloture, but then move fairly deliberately to a vote on
ratification.
The end is in sight...."

7083,"Keith Richards Has Memories to Burn
By JANET MASLIN
It is 3 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time in the New York office of Keith Richards's manager, a place that might look ordinary if
every wall and shelf were not crammed with some of the world's most glorious rock 'n' roll memorabilia. Mr. Richards has
a 3 o'clock appointment. ""Come on in, he'll be here in a minute,"" an assistant says — and here he comes in a minute, at
3:01. This from a man who once prided himself for operating on Keith Time, as in: the security staff ate the shepherd's pie
that Keith wanted in his dressing room? Then everyone in this packed stadium can bloody well wait. The Rolling Stones
don't play until another shepherd's pie shows up.
Chalk up the promptness to the man's new incarnation: he is now Keith Richards, distinguished author. True, he is far
from the only rock star to turn memoirist, and far from the only Rolling Stone to write a book about himself — very much
about himself. The raven-haired Ron Wood wrote ""Ronnie,"" in which he described Brian Jones as ""me in a blond wig."" Bill
Wyman, the band's retired bass player and bean counter, wrote ""Stone Alone,"" in which not a 15-shilling demo disc went
unmentioned. Now Mr. Richards has written the keeper: ""Life,"" a big, fierce, game-changing account of the Stones' nearly
half-century-long adventure.
""It's the most difficult thing I've ever done,"" he says about the book. ""I'd rather make ro records.""
But he sounds anything but weary. And he seems refreshed, bearing surprisingly little resemblance to the battered, kohl-
eyed pirate Keith Richards who looks like 50 miles of bad road. Today, in neutral street clothes and hot-green shoes, he is
positively debonair. On his hands: the ubiquitous silver skull ring, swollen knuckles, the thin white scar from a hunk of
steaming phosphorus that burned his finger to the bone while he played through a concert without stopping. On his head:
both a headband and a raffish, straw-colored hat, gray tufts poking out in all directions. Not a single gewgaw hangs off it.
""I've been through that phase,"" he says. ""Don't know that the hair will take the pressure anymore.""
He's been through quite a lot of phases. And they're all on the page in ""Life"": the Boy Scout (really); the tyro rocker; the
lovestruck kid (mad for Ronnie Spector, unbeknownst to Phil Spector); the astonished new star; the heroin-addicted older
one; the jaded veteran of countless world tours; and the longtime sparring partner of Mick Jagger. (Despite tabloid shock
over the bickering in the book, these two have seriously been calling each other names at least since the early 198os.) All of
this is recounted with straight-up candor, and some of it is easily sensationalized. But the book's single biggest stunner is a
hand-written note on its jacket flap: ""Believe it or not, I haven't forgotten any of it.""
How, he is asked, is this humanly possible from a man as well known for stupefaction as ""Satisfaction?"" ""I think my main
concern at the beginning was whether my memory was really reliable,"" he says. ""Fox had to do a little sleuthing."" Fox is
James Fox, the journalist and author of ""White Mischief,"" who has been Mr. Richards's friend over many years and was
his collaborator in putting ""Life"" together. (It was sold to Little, Brown & Company for a reported advance of more than $7
million.)
Mr. Fox wound up researching Mr. Richards's past, conducting interviews with those who knew him long ago and drawing
upon wonderfully candid old letters and journal entries. ""Spent day practising,"" the 19-year-old Mr. Richards wrote in
January 1963, when the Stones were just beginning to play in public. ""Worthwhile, I hope!"" Also exhumed: a 1962 letter
from Mr. Richards to his Aunt Patty describing a boy he had known in primary school, Mick Jagger. He signs off
""Luff/Keith XXXXX""
These artifacts turned out to be the Richards equivalent of Proust's madeleines, though Mr. Richards, whose reading taste
runs to naval history and the novels of Patrick O'Brian and George MacDonald Fraser, would hardly put it that way. In any
case they prompted recollections that he never expected to rediscover, and ""Life"" began to click. Once his stories were told
and a draft was written, he and Mr. Fox wound up sitting together with separate copies of the manuscript as Mr. Fox read
B6
the whole book aloud. ""What I couldn't guess was that he'd be such a very good natural editor,"" Mr. Fox, reached by e-
mail, says of Mr. Richards. ""He cut, accordingly, for pace and rhythm — a real musical cut.""
As for calling the book ""Life,"" Mr. Richards did some editing there too. ""My Life"" was what the book was to be called. ""I
said 'I tell you what, just cut off the 'My,' and you've got a title,"" he says. He might just as appropriately have used another
title he likes, ""Keep It Dark."" But, he says, ""I'm saving it for a song.""
The contents of ""Life"" are dark enough already. The book begins with a 1975 drug bust in Arkansas and a judge who was
persuaded to free Mr. Richards after confiscating his hunting knife (which still hangs in the courtroom) and having a
picture taken with him. How did Mr. Richards get so lucky? ""I really can't explain it,"" he says, deadpan, about that now.
""Maybe I've got an honest face.""
It covers many other arrests too, as well as Mr. Richards's grueling efforts to kick his heroin addiction, which he claims to
have done successfully 30 years ago. ""Stories like this aren't told very much,"" he insists. ""There aren't many people willing
to tell them.""
Then there are the other health hazards that the book describes. Like electrocution. ""My most spectacular one was in
Sacramento. ..."" he now says with a smile, drifting off into a fond-sounding reverie that involves a guitar string touching an
ungrounded microphone and clouds of smoke billowing out of his mouth. He has a good laugh at the memory of finding
himself in a hospital and hearing a doctor say, ""Well, they either wake up or they don't.""
""Life"" has already attracted undue attention for a schoolyard-sounding anatomical swipe at Mr. Jagger. But this is a book
that pulls no punches, and most of its disses are more serious than that. ""Cold-blooded"" and ""vicious"" are only two of the
more printable words he uses to describe Brian Jones. Allen Ginsberg was an ""old gasbag."" Mick Taylor, the former
Rolling Stone, ""didn't do anything"" after he left the band, and Donald Cammell, the film director (""Performance,"" starring
Mr. Jagger and Anita Pallenberg, Mr. Richards's longtime lover and partner in crime), couldn't commit suicide quickly
enough to suit Mr. Richards. (He shot himself in 1996.) When Marlon Brando propositioned him and Ms. Pallenberg, Mr.
Richards remembers replying with this: ""Later, pal.""
As for Mr. Jagger, the complaints are deep-seated. They involve credit hogging, social climbing, egomania, insecurity,
unethical business behavior and — here comes a Freudian's holiday for anyone who's ever watched the bare-chested young
Jagger and Richards vamp it up together — uncertain sexual identity. There's also a cool condescension about Mr. Jagger's
contributions to the duo's songwriting. And a nasty nickname or two, like ""Disco Boy.""
In conversation about all this, Mr. Richards is emphatically blase: ""It's bound to be somewhat rough, but the point is I'm
trying to tell the story from Day 1 to now,"" he says. And sure: ""There's the odd conflict here and there. But if you weigh it
all out, those things count for nothing."" Mr. Richards did see to it that Mr. Jagger knew what was in the book ahead of
time. ""The important thing to me,"" he says, ""was that Mick had been through it and seen it and knew what was what.""And
is there anything that one Stone can say about another Stone and really give offense at this point? ""No.""
But is there anything new that can be said about the Stones anyway? As ""Life"" emphatically demonstrates, the answer is
yes. And some of its most surprisingly revelatory material appears in what Mr. Richards jokingly calls ""Keefs Guitar
Workshop."" Here are the secrets of some of the world's most famous rock riffs and the almost toy-level equipment on
which they were recorded, like the cassette recorder onto which Mr. Richards dubbed guitar layer after guitar layer for
""Street Fighting Man,"" ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" and part of ""Gimme Shelter."" Here's how the silent beats in Elvis Presley's
""Heartbreak Hotel"" worked their way into some of Mr. Richards's most inspired solos. Mr. Fox found that ""Heartbreak
Hotel"" itself was the key to some of Mr. Richards's best musical memories.
Some of this is by now well known to music critics. But Mr. Richards makes it fascinating at the layman's level. And he is
surprised to find that early readers haven't been skipping the musicology, even though the book cordially invites them to
do so. What he finds most gratifying about having written ""Life"" is the chance for both him and his readers to grasp the
breadth and range of this book's material. He is the rare memoirist who can say, without hyperbole, ""that what I hoped
was worth sharing with people turned out to be far more important than I could possibly imagine.""
It's getting late. Time to leave this bright orange room where Mr. Richards's name is emblazoned on a director's chair;
where assorted music awards and platinum records are everywhere; where there's a discreet little skull in the middle of
the wall mirror; where his Louis Vuitton guitar case — he did an ad for Vuitton — is parked in a corner. But the items
likeliest to catch his eye are the ones on the coffee table: loose cigarettes neatly arrayed in a holder, a lighter, more
cigarettes in a pack.
""Do you mind if I smoke?"" he had asked when he first appeared. Easy one: Who, aside from Keith Richards and certain
legal authorities, has ever kept Keith Richards from doing anything? But an hour has gone by, and he hasn't touched the
cigarettes. He hasn't even looked at them. He has done not one thing to make him resemble the sullen, haunted,
diabolically beautiful creature on the cover of his book, the one with hellfire blazing up from his hand to meet the blurry
white thing he's smoking.
""That?"" he says innocently when asked about the picture. ""Oh, that's just me lighting a cigarette. That's all I was doing."""
7084,"aned by Woodward's Fire
by Leslie H. Gelb
September 23, 2010 I 1:32pm
The president and his team cooperated with the famed author's new book. Leslie H. Gelb on the
fallout—and how Obama's Wars shows the U.S. is stuck in an open-ended conflict.
Lots of White House officials observed Bob Woodward, Mr. First Draft of History, repeatedly and boldly slipping behind the
closed doors of President Obama's most intimate advisers. They all knew what was happening. The president's men were
helping The Washington Post's sleuth write ""the inside story"" of how the boss masterfully managed the most trying of
Herculean labors—the war in Afghanistan. There's only one very big problem in dealing with Woodward in this manner:
Once the boss opens the doors to spilling the secrets, many of his subordinates feel liberated to ""tell their side of the
story."" By the time each has exhausted tales of his own heroism and the shortcomings of his fellow senior officials, well,
no one looks terribly heroic.
Let's start with Obama, who emerges from the pages of Obama's Wars as he is—brilliant, emotionless, abstract, focused,
and confused, a Chicago law-school professor in presidents' clothes. He obviously wanted Woodward to portray him as a
brilliant intellectual leader of a government that was not giving him too much help in solving the Afghan mystery, but that
he trudged on, doing the best anyone possibly could under these terrible circumstances.
The worst circumstance, as Team Obama alleged to Woodward, was that the Pentagon leadership and the U.S. generals
did not give him the real choices he was asking for. He wanted options for troop increases below, even far below, what
the generals were giving him. He didn't get them. He wanted a strategy for how U.S. forces would be drawn down after
they reached their projected peak of about 100,000 (more than three times the number George W. Bush left him). The
military didn't provide him with that, either.
As they say in Missouri, ""Give me a break."" If the commander in chief of the United States doesn't know how to get what
he wants from the U.S. military, he might want to do something about that. And some of the many generals in the White
House who he picked to guide him might have told him how to go about that task. To cut to the chase: Obama didn't
understand what he had to do—tell Defense Secretary Bob Gates to tell the generals either they meet the president's
wishes or they will be fired. Republican presidents do just that. And so, as Woodward describes, Obama had to write the
strategy all by himself.
This was and still is an awful situation that springs from two sources. One is that the president has just not been clear
enough about his thinking and objectives for Afghanistan, and the military and the rest of us must have real clarity to
pursue wars. Woodward has this right. Here are a few Obama quotes that illustrate the problem. The president told
Woodward that he didn't think about the Afghan war in the ""classic"" terms of the U.S. winning or losing. ""I think about it
more in terms of: Do you successfully prosecute a strategy that results in the country being stronger rather than weaker at
the end?"" What on earth does that mean? Or try this one, to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) about whether the July 2011
deadline to begin withdrawal was firm: ""I have to say that. I can't let this be a war without end, and I can't lose the whole
Democratic Party."" Does that mean Obama really believes in the war, but his party doesn't? Or to White House aides:
""This needs to be a plan about how we're going to hand it off and get out of Afghanistan."" So, if he wanted such a plan, he
should have gotten such a plan. He is president after all.
Which leads to the second problem: When a president is not clear about a tough problem, the military smells vacillations.
And they sure don't like vacillation when it comes to dispatching their men and women to war. Americans don't fathom
well the military mentality. The military in most countries throughout history doesn't like to go to war; they like to build up
their arms and overall strength. But once in war, they want only more troops, fewer restrictions on their use, and above all,
victory, victory, victory. Since Vietnam, they smell only vacillation among Democrats, and they don't like it. For their part,
Democrats see insubordination and worse among the military toward them, and they don't care for the suits either. It's not
a happy circumstance. Woodward didn't explore this underlying reality, which is critical for Americans to understand.
breakAd
The White House clash with the military could get worse over the latest news about Gen. Stanley McChrystal's firing over
naughty things said about the White House to a reporter. According to a preliminary Army investigation, the general—and
perhaps even his senior Army aides—were not the sources of those nasty quotes. It was some other guys—you know, the
usual culprits, the Navy and civilians. There will be further formal inquiries on this, but nothing good will come of them.
There's another important thread running throughout the Woodward account that, I believe, he gets more wrong than
right. That is, Woodward's repeated insistence of open and bitter policy brawls in the good old Situation Room (the inner
sanctum for White House meetings) over Afghan policy. Mr. Instant Historian paints a picture of a war of all against all. My
information has always been that there was relative agreement on major policy. Based on my sources, there is no doubt
that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Defense Secretary Bob Gates, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen were almost
always quite cordial and in full lock step. They, along with the NSC Adviser Jim Jones and field commanders like General
McChrystal and General Petraeus, are the key players. Of course, Vice President Joe Biden and Chief of Staff Rahm
Emanuel were the only regular critics of where policy was heading. The generals did lobby for their positions in public—in
advance of presidential decisions. And that's a big no-no. But by that standard, almost all Obama's top advisers did as
much. The day after his West Point speech last December, where he set the firm date of July 2011 to begin unspecified
U.S. troop withdrawals, almost all the advisers publicly stated that maybe one didn't have to take this date too seriously,
that everything was ""conditions based."" That group of rebels included Gates and Clinton.
So, if anything, most of Obama's top counselors were more or less united—sometimes against where he seemed to be
going. Here is what Petraeus had to say to Woodward on the subject of goals, and it's a stunner: ""You have to recognize
also that I don't think you win this war. I think you keep fighting. It's a little bit like Iraq, actually.... Yes, there has been
enormous progress in Iraq. But there are still horrific attacks in Iraq, and you have to stay vigilant. You have to stay after
it. This is the kind of fight we're in for the rest of our lives and probably our kids' lives."" The brilliant general said as much
to others over the last year. It's enough to knock your socks off.
So far, there are no heroes to this narrative, only self-described heroic skeptics of the war and warriors who would fight on
forever.
Doubtless, President Obama does not want to fight an open-ended war. He's sworn to that time and again, and I believe
him, despite his history of calling for ""victory"" and ""defeat"" of the Taliban and al Qaeda. But what the Woodward book
demonstrates is that Obama and his team just don't know how to get from here to there. So far, there are no heroes to
this narrative, only self-described heroic skeptics of the war and warriors who would fight on forever.

US Hikers Were Seized in Iraq
By Babak Sarfaraz
Posted on June 24, 2010, Printed on October 22, 2010
http://www.theinvestigativefund.org/investigations/internationa1/1338/
KURDISTAN PROVINCE, IRAN—
Since their arrest last July by Iranian forces near the Iraq
border, three Americans — Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal and
Sarah Shourd — have been at the center of a high-stakes
diplomatic struggle between Tehran and Washington. Iranian
authorities have repeatedly accused the three of entering Iran
to conduct espionage. Meanwhile, friends and family of the
three, along with the State Department, the Committee to
Protect Journalists, The Nation and The Investigative Fund
[Bauer has written Investigative Fund stories that appeared in
The Nation and Mother Jones], have rejected the spying
charge and suggested that the Americans accidentally crossed
the border while on a recreational hike. Despite a well-
publicized visit by the detainees' mothers in May, Iran has
released little information about the circumstances of their
arrest or the status of their case.
The Nation and The Investigative Fund have located two
witnesses to the arrest who claim that Bauer, Fattal and
Shourd were on Iraqi territory when they were arrested — not
in Iran, as Iranian officials have asserted. Two additional
sources report that the Revolutionary Guards officer who
likely ordered their detention has since been arrested on
charges of smuggling, kidnapping and murder.
The witnesses are residents of a Kurdish village in Iraq called
Zalem, which lies a few miles from the Iran border; they
declined to be identified, fearing retaliation from Iranian
forces, who have been known to conduct missions across the
border. The witnesses separately reported noticing the three
Americans as they hiked up a mountain in the scenic Khormal
region, which straddles the border. Part of the mountain lies
in Iraq and part in Iran, but except for a few watchtowers and
occasional signposts, the border here is largely unmarked,
although local residents are familiar with its boundaries.
The witnesses, who followed the Western-looking hikers out
of curiosity, say that around 2 pm on July 31, as the hikers
descended the mountain, uniformed guards from NAJA,
Iran's national police force, waved the hikers toward the
Iranian side using ""threatening"" and ""menacing"" gestures.
When their calls were ignored, one officer fired a round into
the air. As the hikers continued to hesitate, the guards walked
a few yards into Iraqi territory, where they lack jurisdiction,
and apprehended them.
These witness accounts corroborate a statement Bauer made
on May 20 during a tele-vised reunion at a Tehran hotel
between the hikers and their mothers. As the New York Times
reported, Bauer ""denied that they had walked into Iran, as
they were accused of doing, before stopping himself and
saying, 'We can't really talk about that.""
Farhad Lohoni, a local tribal leader, had previously claimed
that the American hikers had been snatched from Iraq in a
cross-border raid by Iranian agents, as reported in the Daily
Telegraph in August 2009. Lohoni said that his relatives had
seen a group of men cross the border into Iraq, and he told the
Telegraph that the hikers ""were targeted and captured by a
group that came over from Iran, ignoring Iraq's sovereignty.
We know this and it means that Iran must have wanted to take
Americans hostage at this sensitive time.""
A State Department spokesman said that he had been unaware
of evidence that the three were arrested in Iraqi territory but
would not comment further.
Once captured, Bauer, Fattal and Shourd were sped by car to
the local headquarters of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in
Marivan, a town close to the border in the province of
Kurdistan. When they arrived, according to two sources, the
Americans were remanded into the custody of Lt. Col. Heyva
Taab, then head of the Revolutionary Guards' intelligence
unit in the region. According to these sources — a former
member of the Revolutionary Guards and an official who
serves in the provincial government at Sanandaj — only Taab
would have had the authority to order the Americans'
detention and eventual transfer to Tehran. A branch of the
Iranian military with at least 125,000 personnel, the
Revolutionary Guards are responsible for maintaining
national security throughout the Islamic Republic.
""When I heard the news that they had arrested American
hikers, I immediately thought, This is the work of the
intelligence arm of the Revolutionary Guards, because they
have people in this region,"" says Idris Ahmedi, an Iranian
Kurdish exile and a regional expert who is a visiting scholar
at Georgetown University. ""I thought they were most likely
lured into Iranian Kurdistan, where they could arrest them. It
is consistent with Iran's past actions.""
Less than a month later, in late August 2009, Taab himself
was arrested and charged with the July 6 murder of the son of
Mostafa Shirzadi, the Imam Joma (Friday prayer leader) of
Marivan, an influential cleric in the region. Shirzadi's nephew
was also allegedly killed by Taab. Since his arrest Taab has
been implicated in a vast criminal enterprise encompassing a
profitable smuggling operation and dozens of murders, rapes
and kidnappings. According to the Sanandaj official,
numerous lawsuits, perhaps hundreds, have been filed against
Taab in Kurdistan, alleging libel, theft, rape, kidnapping and
murder. Taab's case has twice been before a judge, and he
awaits execution in a Tehran prison.
Although the state-run Iranian press has not reported on
Taab's crimes, they were made public in a series of articles in
January and February by a Kurdish news site, Kurdistan Va
Kurdnews, run by the Kurdistan Democratic Party. A
February 17 article describes Taab as the head of a ""criminal
band"" and reports that Taab and seven accomplices were
under arrest by the Revolutionary Guards for their role in a
vast number of illegal killings.
Several sources describe Taab as the central power in
Kurdistan province. According to locals and experts, control
of the border lies in the hands of the Revolutionary Guards, in
particular their intelligence unit, Etelaat Sepah, whose local
division had been commanded by Taab for about five years.
""At this point it's really the Sepah, the Revolutionary Guards,
that are in charge, especially in the western provinces,
especially because the Americans are on the other side, in
Iraq,"" says Kaveh Ehsani, an assistant professor of
international studies at DePaul University and an Iran expert
who serves as a contributing editor to the journal Middle East
Report. ""On the surface the security force [NAJA] is in
charge, but it really is the Revolutionary Guards that control
the borders.""
It is a region where, according to several Iran experts,
smuggling and cross-border traffic are routine. The Iraq-Iran
border is ""relatively porous because it's mountainous,"" says
Faraz Sanei, an Iran researcher at Human Rights Watch,
which issued a report last year on political freedom in Iranian
Kurdistan. Sanei describes the border as a common escape
route for dissidents —journalists, human rights advocates
and Iranian Kurds—as well as a commonly used trade route
for goods. ""Smuggling is something that has taken place and
continues to take place there, whether it be of goods or of
humans across the border. It's something that happens quite
often.""
Soon after Taab took charge of the Sepah in the northwestern
quadrant of Kurdistan, he began to enrich himself off the
black-market border economy. According to the Sanandaj
official and the former Revolutionary Guards officer, who
had firsthand knowledge of Taab's activities, Taab's first
scheme involved selling merchandise confiscated from petty
smugglers, known as koolbars, who traffic consumer goods
across the border (a trade depicted in the Iranian film A Time
for Drunken Horses, which won the Camera d'Or at Cannes
in 2000).
The region is also home to a variety of Kurdish nationalist
groups that have been demanding autonomy from the central
Tehran government. One of these, the Party for Free Life in
Kurdistan (PJAK), is affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers'
Party, a Kurdish separatist organization that engages in armed
conflict within Turkey and has been labeled a terrorist
organization by the United States and other governments.
Since 2005 PJAK, based in the mountains in Kurdish Iraq,
has been in open conflict with Tehran and has claimed
responsibility for killing dozens of Revolutionary Guards
soldiers in cross-border raids on Iranian military bases, as
well as for the February 2007 downing of an Iranian military
helicopter by a shoulder-launched missile in Khoy, in
Western Azerbaijan province, which killed thirteen Iranian
soldiers.
It has been speculated that some of these Kurdish militants
enjoy US support. In April 2006, Representative Dennis
Kucinich wrote a letter to President Bush questioning whether
the US government was ""fomenting opposition and
supporting military operations in Iran among insurgent groups
and Iranian ethnic minority groups, some of whom are
operating from Iraq."" Kucinich named two groups, including
PJAK. In November of that year, Seymour Hersh reported in
The New Yorker that ""Israel and the United States have also
been working together in support of a Kurdish resistance
group known as the Party for Free Life in Kurdistan,"" and that
a government consultant told him that the Israeli government
had provided ""equipment and training"" to PJAK.
The United States and Israel have denied any involvement
with PJAK. Still, these allegations of support have gained
substantial traction inside Iran and may have undergirded
Taab's decision to detain Bauer, Fattal and Shourd as well as
the repeated public charges of espionage against the three. In
early April, for instance, Iranian Intelligence Minister Heydar
Moslehi told Iran's Press TV that ""it is quite obvious to us
that the three Americans arrested in Iran last year had links
with Western and Israeli intelligence services.""
The Iranian government has retaliated against rising Kurdish
militancy by launching a counteroffensive on PJAK, inside
Iran and across the border in Iraq. In August 2007, for
example, Iranian soldiers crossed into Iraq and attacked
several villages, McClatchy reported. Most recently, on June
4, officials in Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish region alleged
that ""a small unit of Iranian soldiers,"" including a tank and
several other vehicles, had penetrated more than a mile into
Iraqi Kurdistan's Arbil province in search of Kurdish rebels.
Until his arrest, Taab was a key player in Iran's counter-
offensive. The former Revolutionary Guards officer says that
several current members of the Guards told him that Taab's
stated goal was to ""completely wipe out PJAK"" in his
jurisdiction. According to Alunedi, the scholar at
Georgetown, Taab was involved in recent cross-border
assassinations of Iranian Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan. The
Kurdish weekly Awena reported that Taab and his unit
assassinated two Kurds on December 15, 2008.
According to the former officer and the Sanandaj official,
Taab's criminal enterprise grew beyond smuggling in 2007,
when he made his first forays into murder. Koolbars, the petty
border smugglers, are often killed by land mines or fatally
shot by border police. So Taab concocted a scheme to kidnap
koolbars as well as ordinary unemployed Iranian Kurdish
civilians, dress them in the uniforms of PJAK insurgents and
then kill them—claiming they'd died in a military clash—in
order to collect a bounty, as high as $40,000 a head, from his
superiors in the Revolutionary Guards. He was assisted in this
plot by at least nine others, seven of whom have been
apprehended. The article in Kurdistan Va Kurdnews named
all seven, including Haji Majid Muqimiyan of Kermansha,
identified as a ringleader.
PJAK has officially denied involvement in these border
clashes, including in a May 3, 2009, post to the Iranian
website Tabnak, which is published by Mohsen Rezai, a
former head of the Revolutionary Guards. Many of the PJAK
clashes may, in fact, have been ""bogus,"" said the Sanandaj
official. ""More or less no clashes with PJAK have been
reported in the area since Heyva Taab and his gang were
busted.""
A mother of one koolbar tearfully described her son's
disappearance. She said he went missing the same day in
early 2009 that the government later claimed a clash with
PJAK had taken place. The woman, a resident of a border
town in Iranian Kurdistan, is a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits
against Taab; she asked that her name and location not be
mentioned, for fear that it would harm her case in court.
Taab's scheme was wildly successful, according to the
Sanandaj official, who said one bank account under Taab's
name has had nearly $6 million deposited in it since 2008.
This macabre scheme ended only in the spring of 2009, when
Taab killed a local official's brother who was seeking work in
the area and, more decisively, last July when he killed the
cleric's son.
On June 11 Mohammad Javad Larijani, secretary general of
Iran's High Council for Human Rights, said that the
government's investigation was nearly complete and a trial
for Bauer, Fattal and Shourd ""should not be very far from
now."" In a statement issued on June 17, the mothers of the
hikers called on Iran either to prosecute or release their
children. ""Iran has no legitimate reason at this stage not to
release them or move forward with a fair trial in which our
children can openly answer any allegations against them.""
""These new revelations, if indeed true, show the hikers have
been victims of political machinations and manipulation,""
said Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the International
Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. ""The fact that they have
been held for so long without prosecution strongly supports
this trend. Under Iranian laws, they have committed no crime
and should be released immediately. Their Iranian lawyer,
who has studied the judicial files against them, has
consistently maintained the only charge against them is illegal
entry, which is subject to a fine and not arbitrary detention for
so long. With this new information, even that charge appears
fabricated, and there is no basis for holding them.""
As of the press date, Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal and Sarah
Shourd have been detained by Iran for ten months and
twenty-three days.

Iran Seized U.S. Hikers in Iraq, U.S. Report
Asserts
By MICHAEL R. GORDON and ANDREW W. LEHREN
Iran has accused three American hikers of illegally crossing into Iranian territory in July 2009 and is still holding two of
them in prison. But a classified American military report made public by WikiLeaks, which describes the chaotic day when
the hikers were detained, asserts that the hikers were on the Iraqi side of the border when they were seized.
The initial reports of any incident are not always correct. But one American government official who served in Iraq said
that the field report was generally consistent with what he had been told by Iraqi officials — namely, that the hikers were
close to the border but on the Iraqi side.
The episode began when four Americans traveled from Syria to northern Iraq, planning to hike up the Ahmed Awa, a
mountainous area with a dramatic waterfall. One American, Shon Meckfessel, became ill and stayed behind when his
friends — Shane M. Bauer, Joshua F. Fattal and Sarah E. Shourd — set out on July 31.
A July 31 field report states that Mr. Meckfessel learned of the arrests when a ""female called him saying they were being
surrounded by armed men.""
At first, the American military did not know who was holding the Americans. An intelligence officer at the American Army
division based in northern Iraq, the report notes, initially described the event as a ""kidnapping"" and said the three
American tourists ""were being taken to the Iranian border.""
The report lists a number of military grids where the Americans were believed to have been hiking or had been detained
— all on the Iraqi side of the border.
As documented in the report, the frenetic effort to locate the American hikers and to inter-view Mr: Meckfessel appeared to
support the claim that they were tourists and not American intelligence operatives, as Iran has alleged. A drone aircraft
was sent to look for the missing Americans, and two F-16s jet fighters were alerted. American Special Operations forces
were sent to pick up Mr. Meckfessel, so he could be taken to Baghdad for questioning.
As the day wore on, the Americans received a report from an officer with the pesh merga, the Kurdish military force in
northern Iraq, that the Iranians had detained three American citizens ""for being too close to the border."" The July report
reflects some frustration with the hikers for their ""lack of coordination"" in venturing to northern Iraq and offers some
thoughts on the episode's broader implications.
""The leadership in Iran benefits as it focuses the Iranian population on a perceived external threat rather than internal
dissension,"" it notes. Read the Document >>"

of Tony. He ends: ""Turns the page.. .the work of the new generation begins."" Sid"
7169,"Ed Miliband's victory was carried by an anti-Blair undercurrent. In the first round voting, David was ahead. But when the
votes of Ed Balls was distributed to the second choice of voters, they put Ed over. Balls represents Gordon, but even
more a distancing from New Labour. Ed's use of Iraq as an issue is symbolic of the repudiation of New Labour. Ed had
more labor union votes for leader, which accounted for one-third of total. Ed's ""new generation"" rhetoric covers that
regression and continuing reactive impulse. Now the shadow cabinet, due to a new decision, will be elected by the party.
Ed is the former environment minister and good on green issues, of course, but has no foreign policy perspective
yet instinctively to the left, which means anti-Afghanistan mission as currently conceived, it should go without saying.
David lost precisely because he held responsible positions.

There is a context section at the bottom, which is longer than I would like, but I
think it is important to articulate what I saw and whom I spoke with (and what I
didn't see and whom I didn't meet) so that you understand my data set and its clear
limitations. To say I was profoundly disturbed by what I saw - and didn't see -
would be an understatement. The incompetence is mind numbing. Not incidentally,
it rained twice while I was there. If we do not quickly change the organization,
management, accountability and delivery paradigm on the ground, we could quite
conceivably confront tens of thousands of children's deaths by diarrhea, dysentery,
typhoid and other water-related diseases in the near future. Below are my major
takeaways and a few nascent/early thoughts on what we (however we define we)
could to do drive significant and incremental improvements on the ground in the
near and longer term. As is often said, if I had more time - and less emotion - I
would have written a shorter letter. I hope this mini-behemoth is not rife with
grammatical errors or inadvertent gaps; I am sorry if either true.
Please do not forward this in whole or in part attributed to me without asking me
first - happy to be an invisible soldier. Mainly hope this is even marginally helpful.
Thanks,
Chelsea
Takeaways are below, with illustrative examples, in a logical flow, not order of
importance. Bolded what I think most important.:
Haitians want to help themselves and want the international community to
help them help themselves - this sounds obvious but wasn't to some of the
UN and International NGO (INGO) folks I ran across. The UN people I
encountered were frequently out of touch (e.g., would not have been off
Logbase in days - or ever), anachronistic at best and arrogant and
incompetent at worst (e.g., one woman from the UN -UNDP I think - told me
she was waiting for the Haitians to ""demand their political rights"" - when
they're asking for tents, latrines, soap, food and not getting that....)
In fact, Haitians in the settlements are very much organizing themselves,
in part to help define their needs and then articulate them to the UN/
INGO community. Fairly nuanced settlement governance structures
have already developed. The largest settlement I visited in Parc Jean Marie
Vincent (40k and counting) had an overall governing committee with a head
of the governing committee (voted on by the governing committee); a
women's committee; a security committee; a sanitation committee (with a
soap subcommittee), etc. Women comprised 50% of each committee. One of
the most illuminating anecdotes from my trip was talking with the head of
the security committee and a few other settlement residents, including 2
women from the governing committee. The security committee wanted 100
tshirts - at least though I think they'll need at least 2-3x that - so that the
security volunteers could wear them when patrolling so that people,
particularly women, would feel safe when they saw them approach in groups
of 2 or 3. They also ideally wanted flashlights to also use on night patrol.
Finally, they wanted to be able to pay the security team (though this was less
important than the first two 'asks'). IF that option were not feasible, their
second choice was for the US Army to come into the settlement and patrol at
night. Not the Haitian police (unreliable) and not the UN (dismissed). They
wanted to help themselves, and they wanted reliability and accountability.
The settlements' governing bodies - as they shared with me - are
beginning to experience UN/ INGO fatigue given how often they articulate
their needs, willingness to work - and how little is coming their way. Tents
and latrines / sanitation remain the largest urgent needs - obvious to
anyone with a minimum knowledge of public health and the settlement
residents themselves
The Haitian government appears to have an emergent, albeit still
largely lacking in specifics, plan of action (detailed below), for both the
near (to get through the next 6-12 months) and longer term (while
rebuilding over next -5 years)
The Haitian government's inability to articulate its plan quickly enough
or in sufficient terms to the UN/ INGO community has lead to a
proliferation of ad hoc efforts by the UN and INGOs to 'help,' some of
which have helped (e.g., we met no one who was worried about water
supplies in camps even though it's a motley crue of French Red Cross, Oxfam,
IMO/IOM, etc that have achieved that), some of which have hurt (e.g., the
largest settlement we visited had 1 latrine to every 1,000 people or 40 for
-40k though given the settlements' growth rate its probably 40 for -45k
today; there should be 1 for every 50 people or 800+ latrines) and some
which have not happened at all (e.g., the only settlements with lights at
night are those in areas that had lights before that continue to work;
settlement at the Petionville Golf Club, for instance, has some lights at night
while most sit in darkness)
This disorganization across the UN/ INGOs has had a variety of effects
on the Haitian government, including that it it has now visibly distanced
itself from the UN Cluster process (e.g., instead of going to a meeting a day
the Haitian Minister of Health is now going once a week - because it was
""such a waste of time"" and he said that is representative of the government's
current modus operandi); though we heard the cluster process was
improving - when I asked for a concrete example of how, I was told meetings
were ""more efficient."" This lack of efficiency - not to mention lack of visible
consistent progress - has also lead to a further distrust of the UN/ INGOs
by the Haitian government and Haitian people in the settlements. The
former feels like it shows up to no effect - and the latter feels like very
few actor(s) reliably show up
Again, the UN seemed at best chaotic and at worst absent as I travelled
around in an action-oriented sense - I saw few IOM/IMO tents in settlements
or workers or evidence of work; no evidence of WHO; no evidence of OSHA;
no evidence of... You get the picture. I did see lots of UN peacekeepers riding
around however in their vans, humvees, etc. Though on the point of trucks, I
asked how many trucks were in the country - including the non-Port Au
Prince UN 'bases' - and no one could tell me. There appears to be NO
accessible and usable UN inventory system or logistics operation. WFP,
for instance, is largely piggy backing on the US Army/ SOUTHCOM but the
""UN"" / OSHA could not tell me how many trucks WFP had, much less how
many the UN itself had. I counted - I kid you not - hundreds of trucks and
cars at the UN logbase and other UN bases we drove by
UNICEF was the only UN agency that seemed to be universally
acknowledged to be doing a good job by settlements' residents, by
Haitian doctors and by INGO partners, perhaps in part because of its
narrowly defined agenda currently in Haiti (vaccinations) and that its
reliable - i.e., it shows up when it says it will in the settlements and other
central locations
There is NO accountability in the UN system or international
humanitarian system (including for/ among INGOs), this is not new news
but it is one area that the Cluster approach had aimed to remedy - e.g., there
is no feedback mechanism for when the British Red Cross dug the 34 of the
40 above latrines only 3 feet deep and didn't tell the residents when they
would come and extract the latrines or properly train people to take care of
the latrines, etc. - that malpractice continuum is appalling and the British
Red Cross should know better—at the least, the British Red Cross
subsequently should not be allowed to dig elsewhere/ 'do' latrines
The cash-for-work program the UN heralds is not working optimally, to
put it mildly. It currently focuses - perhaps solely - on debris cleaning -
important no doubt - but it has not extended its work into the
settlements or helped set standardized, and differentiated wages, for
settlement work. For instance, the UN cash for work program should have
already started to pay people in the more organized camps - to clean
latrines; 'guard' latrines, including insuring kids use soap; be teachers; be on
security patrol; be on evacuation duty; work with the WFP during the XYZ
drop times, etc.... NONE of this is happening as far as I can tell. When we
were there the cash for work program head was still focused only - it
appeared - on rubble cleaning.
Re: education in the settlements and beyond: This is theoretically the
responsibility of UNICEF and Save the Children - I heard they're starting to
work on this but that is all I know. Ad hoc schools have begun in some of the
camps. We met a woman - our host in fact - who working with the Israeli
Agency for International Development Cooperation - had started schools in 4
settlements for at least the next month.
The World Food Program continues to NOT buy locally - which is
probably now a moot point as it appears that the dairy, fruit, vegetable and
grain stores have all spoiled. The WFP also seems to have been rather erratic
in the early days but most people I spoke to said WFP is now more
systematic and reliable in its food delivery. However, it had not yet
started to deliver cooking and eating utensils though these are promised for
next week.
In contrast to the UN, there appears to be respect for the US Military on
the ground - for the Army particularly as that is the branch people see
guarding the hospital - and it is a negative comment on the UN forces given
their effective absence. I saw no anti-US graffiti though the walls now are
covered in parts of downtown with anti 'ONG' (NGO) and anti-UN graffiti.
(Also, not only graffiti writers with the above sentiments; one of the Haitian
doctors I met said, ""We must be so poor we can't tell them [UN and INGOs]
what to do - or kick them out and use the money ourselves.""). There is also
great fear - at least from the Haitian and ex-pat medical community-
that the Army is leaving soon largely because of the security and total
organization vacuum that would then be left around the hospital. The
UN community, in contrast, did not seem to be perturbed by this prospect.
On an unrelated note, the absence of the Catholic Church's efforts is
notable, particularly given the high death toll among priests, nuns and
seminarians. Catholic Relief Services is present.
Thoughts on what is needed - and what we could do below. (I know much of this
is familiar.):
The Office of Special Envoy - i.e., you Dad - needs authority over the UN
and all its myriad parts - which I do believe would give you effective
authority over much of then INGO sphere given how persistently the
collective humanitarian community holding onto cluster approach. I know
you know this and are working on it. OSHA clearly is failing on the ground,
otherwise it could be ""empowered"" to do this but it ostensibly already is.
However, regardless of the attachment to clusters, there needs to be a
single point of authority either over UN / INGO efforts on the ground
organized in one of two principle ways: either expertise areas (e.g.,
latrines, lights) or by settlements/ Port Au Prince regions with constituent
settlements, with full structures - e.g., finance, procurement, project
management etc., understanding certain functional areas would be cross-
cutting (e.g., pay for work)
There needs to be a coordinated logistics effort which should follow from
the above with an urgency on procurement and deployment of latrines,
tents and lights - and what is needed to support installment, servicing,
maintenance, etc of each. In parallel, a new logistics center/ warehouse
coordinating facility should be built; every non-UN logistics-focused person I
talked to said a need exists for a new logistic center near the major seaport.
A plan must be developed for the rainy season, which is already on us,
particularly for the settlements and it should include answers to questions
like where can people evacuate to when it rains? How will they access food
and water and latrines, at a minimum, from those spaces? Also, could those
places be multipurpose, e.g., also schools and clinic tents/semi permanent
structures (one engineer talked to me about fiberglass?)?
On pay for work, UN needs to expand its mandate and coordinate with
relevant INGO partners to start employing people, at differential wages, in
the settlements and coordinate with the groups above to ensure consistent
wages until a 'market' could develop
The UN - IMO/IOM - or someone needs to take a monthly census of the
settlements at the minimum
Speaking of censuses, the UN also needs a census of itself and its materials
in country - including of the peacekeeper bases outside Port Au Prince.
For example, we drove by 2 bases on the way to Cange and there were
collectively, I would estimate, more than a hundred trucks and buses just
sitting between the two, as well as at least 800 Napali soldiers (according to
locals) laying effectively fallow - and I don't think anyone expects an
outbreak of violence on the Central Plateau in the near future so even if they
and their colleagues are deployed under UN Charter Chapter 6, surely
preserving the peace could be interpreted to work with the settlements? At
the least, their hardware could be used more effectively in Port Au Prince
Special/ extraordinary management needed around areas that have
received significant attention and offers of assistance, e.g., the general
hospital in Port Au Prince which multiple actors, including Sarkozy, have
now offered to rebuild
Holistically, all of the above should support the Haitian government both
actually and ostensibly to not undermine its authority and also to help
augment and build local capacity and capabilities, where feasible
The UN/ INGO should look to source locally or work with local partners
whenever possible, post emergency phase at the least. For example, work
with local solar light producers, buy from local t-shirt factories (if any
survived outside Port Au Prince), mandate WFP first look to local producers,
etc. Now bias I think has to be on quickest production but in medium term
that should accommodate a local dimension
Re: USNS Comfort: for as long as it is there, at a minimum, its mission
should be expanded such that its military and civilian staff could work
on the physical therapy of earthquake related victims and ideally care for
non-earthquake related cases.
Re: US Army: If its mission is largely coming to an end, I hope there is a
succession plan for its current tasks, e.g., the hospital security, that the
Haitian government is comfortable with; currently Haitian government/ at
least Haitian government people on the proverbial ground have no idea what
the transfer plan is
Re: medical evacuations: think this will be improved given our collectively-
experienced chaos on Sunday
Re: mental health in settlements and beyond: clear people are thinking
about this now - largely because Dad asked about it and made it prominent -
but still unclear what the action plan is
Re: Haitian plan: I am not sure it's the best plan, but it is a plan and we
should work with the government to flush out the details so it is robust and
actionable - not sure who the we is here probably most of all
Re: Catholic church: Could we reach out to the Vatican - or even Catholic
groups/ prominent Catholics domestically to raise money and the necessary
expertise to rebuild the central cathedral and main seminary? It would
be a powerful symbolic statement - and put lots of people to work
Re: status, including mental health of workers there, both Haitian and
ex-pat: I am consciously leaving this off as I just can't process right now
FYI: Emergent Haitian government plan of action, as I understand it:
o Near term/ for the next year
■ Buttress the settlements that currently exist that are not
in the lowest lying flood plans, i.e., get tents and latrines in
place, ensure sufficient amounts of clean water flowing in or
being brought, ensure food supplies sufficient, ensure security
and safety (though this seems to be people-focused only);
ensure medical care accessible; start schools at least for the
youngest children.
▪ Move people who are in the settlements in the worst
geographies for flooding or practical reasons/ other
reasons (e.g., the one currently with 4000 people on the prime
minister's lawn) to pre-constructed tent settlements
elsewhere - they have built the first of these already with INGO
Shelter Box though apparently the tents were put up too close
to one another
• Areas lacking in mention when I heard the above
discussed: a solution to ensure people have somewhere to go
when the heavy rains come; ensure continuity of key services
once the rains come; a solution to ensure people are paid how
to ensure sufficient light in the camps, clearly critical to
security (rapes are skyrocketing and I know there were at least
2 murders in one camp on Saturday night); what the right spec
of tent is for any of the above - housing, clinic, evacuation,
school and what could be multipurpose; plan for older
children/young adults who may be too old for initial school
plan; how to best support / help create where needed
settlement governance; how to census, on a semi-regular basis,
who is in the settlements
® Over next 6-12 months:
o Assess which homes are sufficiently safe for families
to return to and subsequently encourage them to do
so; government estimates this will be —30% of all
homes/families (though this seems to be a guess, i.e., no
evidence base)
• Build semi-permanent settlements or augment pre-
existing villages around Port Au Prince where
feasible to enable the government to move people
out of settlements to those sites. End goal is to move
400-1000 families to each of these as needed
o Longer-term:
• Rebuilt Port Au Prince though it is unclear how/if/why people
would move back or what the government's post-rebuild
vision looks like
■ Build more robust health, education etc systems than existed
before the earthquake
■ *Clearly this is the less well-defined part of the ""plan""

I spent the last four days in Haiti. I was with Paul Farmer (Paul) and Partners in
Health (PIH) the entire time - in Port Au Prince Thursday, Friday and Sunday
afternoon and at PIH sites in Laconville and Cange, in the Central Plateau region
Saturday and Sunday morning. I sat in on Paul's formal meetings in Port Au Prince
with: the Haitian Minister of Health Alex Larsen and his team; the Haitian
government official ostensibly overseeing the reconstruction efforts/ UN liaison
Leslie Voltaire; a x-UN group preparing for the PDNA (post disaster needs
assessment) conference in New York at the end of March working on giving 'voice to
the voiceless,' i.e., the designated 15minutes at the conference to highlight the voices
of those most affected (the 15 minutes I gather are happening at all only because of
Cheryl and Paul), UNDP, UNHCR and others were represented; a group interested in
building a logistics center for the reconstruction efforts, i.e., outside the UN ambit,
including people from Royal Caribbean, McKinsey and the people we were traveling
with, including Wes Edens, CEO of Fortress and a supporter of PIH - and the person
who donated, and continues to donate the space at the Miami airport that PIH,
Clinton Foundation, University of Miami Medical Center and others are using to
move goods by air and sea, via transfer, to Haiti. Informally, I talked with: people in
settlements and settlement committee heads, through a translator; local Haitian
doctors; ex-pat PIH and other doctors in mobile clinics in settlements; doctors,
nurses and US police officers I ran into on the street, at dinner, at their ad hoc
residence in the abandoned Aristide Foundation; Maryse Kedar who hosted us our
nights in Port Au Prince, a member of the local elite, and her ad hoc Israel volunteers
(from the Israeli Agency for International Development Cooperation, ie their USAID,
as mentioned above); a broad swath of people serving on the USNS Comfort, both on
and off the ship; US Army enlisted and officers whenever I saw them; Louise Ivers,
head of PIH in Haiti, and others we met or ran into along the way."

There is a context section at the bottom, which is longer than I would like, but I
think it is important to articulate what I saw and whom I spoke with (and what I
didn't see and whom I didn't meet) so that you understand my data set and its clear
limitations. To say I was profoundly disturbed by what I saw - and didn't see -
would be an understatement. The incompetence is mind numbing. Not incidentally,
it rained twice while I was there. If we do not quickly change the organization,
management, accountability and delivery paradigm on the ground, we could quite
conceivably confront tens of thousands of children's deaths by diarrhea, dysentery,
typhoid and other water-related diseases in the near future. Below are my major
takeaways and a few nascent/early thoughts on what we (however we define we)
could do to drive significant and incremental improvements on the ground in the
near and longer term. As is often said, if I had more time - and less emotion - I
would have written a shorter letter. I hope this mini-behemoth is not rife with
grammatical errors or inadvertent gaps; I am sorry if either true.
Please do not forward this in whole or in part attributed to me without asking me
first - happy to be an invisible soldier. Mainly hope this is even marginally helpful.
Thanks,
Chelsea
Takeaways are below, with illustrative examples, in a logical flow, not order of
importance. Bolded what I think most important.:
- Haitians want to help themselves and want the international community to
help them help themselves - this sounds obvious but wasn't to some of the
UN and International NGO (INGO) folks I ran across. The UN people I
encountered were frequently out of touch (e.g., would not have been off
Logbase in days - or ever), anachronistic in their thinking at best and
arrogant and incompetent at worst (e.g., one woman from the UN - UNDP I
think - told me she was waiting for the Haitians to ""demand their political
rights"" - when they're asking for tents, latrines, soap, food and not getting
that....)
In fact, Haitians in the settlements are very much organizing themselves,
in part to help define their needs and then articulate them to the UN/
INGO community. Fairly nuanced settlement governance structures
have already developed. The largest settlement I visited in Parc Jean Marie
Vincent (40k and counting) had an overall governing committee with a head
of the governing committee (voted on by the governing committee); a
women's committee; a security committee; a sanitation committee (with a
soap subcommittee), etc. Women comprised 50% of each committee. One of
the most illuminating anecdotes from my trip was talking with the head of
the security committee and a few other settlement residents, including 2
women from the governing committee. The security committee wanted 100
tshirts -though I think they'll need at least 2-3x that - so that the security
volunteers could wear them when patrolling so that people, particularly
women, would feel safe when they saw them approach in groups of 2 or 3.
They also ideally wanted flashlights to also use on night patrol. Finally, they
wanted to be able to pay the security team (though this was less important
than the first two `asks'). IF that option were not feasible, their second choice
was for the US Army to come into the settlement and patrol at night. Not the
Haitian police (unreliable) and not the UN (dismissed). They wanted to help
themselves, and they wanted reliability and accountability from their
partners.
The settlements' governing bodies - as they shared with me - are
beginning to experience UN/ INGO fatigue given how often they articulate
their needs, willingness to work - and how little is coming their way. Tents
and latrines / sanitation remain the largest urgent needs - obvious to
anyone with a minimum knowledge of public health and the settlement
residents themselves
The Haitian government appears to have an emergent, albeit still
largely lacking in specifics, plan of action (detailed below), for both the
near (to get through the next 6-12 months) and longer term (while
rebuilding over next -5 years)
The Haitian government's inability to articulate its plan quickly enough
or in sufficient terms to the UN/ INGO community has lead to a
proliferation of ad hoc efforts by the UN and INGOs to 'help,' some of
which have helped (e.g., we met no one who was worried about water
supplies in camps even though it's a motley crue of French Red Cross, Oxfam,
IMO/IOM, etc that have achieved that), some of which have hurt (e.g., the
largest settlement we visited had 1 latrine to every 1,000 people or 40 for
-40k though given the settlements' growth rate its probably 40 for -45k
today; there should be 1 for every 50 people or 800+ latrines) and some
which have not happened at all (e.g., the only settlements with lights at
night are those in areas that had lights before that continue to work;
settlement at the Petionville Golf Club, for instance, has some lights at night
while most sit in darkness)
This disorganization across the UN/ INGOs has had a variety of effects
on the Haitian government, including that it has now visibly distanced
itself from the UN Cluster process (e.g., instead of going to a meeting a day
the Haitian Minister of Health is now going once a week - because it was
""such a waste of time"" and he said that is representative of the government's
current modus operandi); though we heard the cluster process was
improving - when I asked for a concrete example of how, I was told meetings
were ""more efficient."" This lack of efficiency - not to mention lack of visible
consistent progress - has also lead to a further distrust of the UN/ INGOs
by the Haitian government and Haitian people in the settlements. The
former feels like it shows up to no effect - and the latter feels like very
few actor(s) reliably show up
Again, the UN seemed at best chaotic and at worst absent as I travelled
around in an action-oriented sense - I saw few IOM/IMO tents in settlements
or workers or evidence of work; no evidence of WHO; no evidence of OSHA;
no evidence of... You get the picture. I did see lots of UN peacekeepers riding
around however in their vans, humvees, etc. Though on the point of trucks, I
asked how many trucks were in the country - including the non-Port Au
Prince UN 'bases' - and no one could tell me. There appears to be NO
accessible and usable UN inventory system or logistics operation. WFP,
for instance, is largely piggy backing on the US Army/ SOUTHCOM but the
""UN"" / OSHA could not tell me how many trucks WFP had, much less how
many the UN itself had. I counted - I kid you not - hundreds of trucks and
cars at the UN logbase and other UN bases we drove by
UNICEF was the only UN agency that seemed to be universally
acknowledged to be doing a good job by settlements' residents, by
Haitian doctors and by INGO partners, perhaps in part because of its
narrowly defined agenda currently in Haiti (vaccinations) and that its
reliable - i.e., it shows up when it says it will in the settlements and other
central locations
There is NO accountability in the UN system or international
humanitarian system (including for/ among INGOs), this is not new news
but it is one area that the Cluster approach had aimed to remedy - e.g., there
is no feedback mechanism for when the British Red Cross dug the 34 of the
40 above latrines only 3 feet deep and didn't tell the residents when they
would come and extract the latrines or properly train people to take care of
the latrines, etc. - that malpractice continuum is appalling and the British
Red Cross should know better—at the least, the British Red Cross
subsequently should not be allowed to dig elsewhere/ 'do' latrines
The cash-for-work program the UN heralds is not working optimally, to
put it mildly. It currently focuses - perhaps solely - on debris cleaning -
important no doubt - but it has not extended its work into the
settlements or helped set standardized, and differentiated wages, for
settlement work. For instance, the UN cash for work program should have
already started to pay people in the more organized camps - to clean
latrines; 'guard' latrines, including insuring kids use soap; be teachers; be on
security patrol; be on evacuation duty; work with the WFP during the XYZ
drop times, etc.... NONE of this is happening as far as I can tell. When we
were there the cash for work program head was still focused only - it
appeared - on rubble cleaning.
Re: education in the settlements and beyond: This is theoretically the
responsibility of UNICEF and Save the Children - I heard they're starting to
work on this but that is all I know. Ad hoc schools have begun in some of the
camps. We met a woman - our host in fact - who working with the Israeli
Agency for International Development Cooperation - had started schools in 4
settlements for at least the next month.
The World Food Program continues to NOT buy locally - which is
probably now a moot point as it appears that the dairy, fruit, vegetable and
grain stores have all spoiled. The WFP also seems to have been rather erratic
in the early days but most people I spoke to said WFP is now more
systematic and reliable in its food delivery. However, it had not yet
started to deliver cooking and eating utensils though these are promised for
next week.
In contrast to the UN, there appears to be respect for the US Military on
the ground - for the Army particularly as that is the branch people see
guarding the hospital - and it is a negative comment on the UN forces given
their effective absence. I saw no anti-US graffiti though the walls now are
covered in parts of downtown with anti 'ONG' (NGO) and anti-UN graffiti.
(Also, not only graffiti writers with the above sentiments; one of the Haitian
doctors I met said, ""We must be so poor we can't tell them [UN and INGOs]
what to do - or kick them out and use the money ourselves.""). There is also
great fear - at least from the Haitian and ex-pat medical community-
that the Army is leaving soon largely because of the security and total
organization vacuum that would then be left around the hospital. The
UN community, in contrast, did not seem to be perturbed by this prospect.
On an unrelated note, the absence of the Catholic Church's efforts is
notable, particularly given the high death toll among priests, nuns and
seminarians. Catholic Relief Services is present.
Thoughts on what is needed - and what we could do below. (I know much of this
is familiar.):
The Office of Special Envoy - i.e., you Dad - needs authority over the UN
and all its myriad parts - which I do believe would give you effective
authority over much of then INGO sphere given how persistently the
collective humanitarian community holding onto cluster approach. I know
you know this and are working on it. OSHA clearly is failing on the ground,
otherwise it could be ""empowered"" to do this but it ostensibly already is.
However, regardless of the attachment to clusters, there needs to be a
single point of authority either over UN / INGO efforts on the ground
organized in one of two principle ways: either expertise areas (e.g.,
latrines, lights) or by settlements/ Port Au Prince regions with constituent
settlements, with full structures - e.g., finance, procurement, project
management etc., understanding certain functional areas would be cross-
cutting (e.g., pay for work)
There needs to be a coordinated logistics effort which should follow from
the above with an urgency on procurement and deployment of latrines,
tents and lights - and what is needed to support installment, servicing,
maintenance, etc of each. In parallel, a new logistics center/ warehouse
coordinating facility should be built; every non-UN logistics-focused person I
talked to said a need exists for a new logistic center near the major seaport.
A plan must be developed for the rainy season, which is already on us,
particularly for the settlements and it should include answers to questions
like where can people evacuate to when it rains? How will they access food
and water and latrines, at a minimum, from those spaces? Also, could those
places be multipurpose, e.g., also schools and clinic tents/semi permanent
structures (one engineer talked to me about fiberglass?)?
On pay for work, UN needs to expand its mandate and coordinate with
relevant INGO partners to start employing people, at differential wages, in
the settlements and coordinate with the groups above to ensure consistent
wages until a 'market' could develop
The UN - IMO/IOM - or someone needs to take a monthly census of the
settlements at the minimum
Speaking of censuses, the UN also needs a census of itself and its materials
in country - including of the peacekeeper bases outside Port Au Prince.
For example, we drove by 2 bases on the way to Cange and there were
collectively, I would estimate, more than a hundred trucks and buses just
sitting between the two, as well as at least 800 Napali soldiers (according to
locals) laying effectively fallow - and I don't think anyone expects an
outbreak of violence on the Central Plateau in the near future so even if they
and their colleagues are deployed under UN Charter Chapter 6, surely
preserving the peace could be interpreted to work with the settlements? At
the least, their hardware could be used more effectively in Port Au Prince
Special/ extraordinary management needed around areas that have
received significant attention and offers of assistance, e.g., the general
hospital in Port Au Prince which multiple actors, including Sarkozy, have
now offered to rebuild
Holistically, all of the above should support the Haitian government both
actually and ostensibly to not undermine its authority and also to help
augment and build local capacity and capabilities, where feasible
The UN/ INGO should look to source locally or work with local partners
whenever possible, post emergency phase at the least. For example, work
with local solar light producers, buy from local t-shirt factories (if any
survived outside Port Au Prince), mandate WFP first look to local producers,
etc. Now bias I think has to be on quickest production but in medium term
that should accommodate a local dimension
Re: USNS Comfort: for as long as it is there, at a minimum, its mission
should be expanded such that its military and civilian staff could work
on the physical therapy of earthquake related victims and ideally care for
non-earthquake related cases.
Re: US Army: If its mission is largely coming to an end, I hope there is a
succession plan for its current tasks, e.g., the hospital security, that the
Haitian government is comfortable with; currently Haitian government/ at
least Haitian government people on the proverbial ground have no idea what
the transfer plan is
Re: medical evacuations: think this will be improved given our collectively-
experienced chaos on Sunday
Re: mental health in settlements and beyond: clear people are thinking
about this now - largely because Dad asked about it and made it prominent -
but still unclear what the action plan is
Re: Haitian plan: I am not sure it's the best plan, but it is a plan and we
should work with the government to flush out the details so it is robust and
actionable - not sure who the we is here probably most of all
Re: Catholic church: Could we reach out to the Vatican - or even Catholic
groups/ prominent Catholics domestically to raise money and the necessary
expertise to rebuild the central cathedral and main seminary? It would
be a powerful symbolic statement - and put lots of people to work
Re: status, including mental health of workers there, both Haitian and
ex-pat: I am consciously leaving this off as I just can't process right now
FYI: Emergent Haitian government plan of action, as I understand it:
o Near term/ for the next year
■ Buttress the settlements that currently exist that are not
in the lowest lying flood plans, i.e., get tents and latrines in
place, ensure sufficient amounts of clean water flowing in or
being brought, ensure food supplies sufficient, ensure security
and safety (though this seems to be people-focused only);
ensure medical care accessible; start schools at least for the
youngest children.
■ Move people who are in the settlements in the worst
geographies for flooding or practical reasons/ other
reasons (e.g., the one currently with 4000 people on the prime
minister's lawn) to pre-constructed tent settlements
elsewhere - they have built the first of these already with INGO
Shelter Box though apparently the tents were put up too close
to one another
■ Areas lacking in mention when I heard the above
discussed: a solution to ensure people have somewhere to go
when the heavy rains come; ensure continuity of key services
once the rains come; a solution to ensure people are paid how
to ensure sufficient light in the camps, clearly critical to
security (rapes are skyrocketing and I know there were at least
2 murders in one camp on Saturday night); what the right spec
of tent is for any of the above - housing, clinic, evacuation,
school and what could be multipurpose; plan for older
children/young adults who may be too old for initial school
plan; how to best support / help create where needed
settlement governance; how to census, on a semi-regular basis,
who is in the settlements
■ Over next 6-12 months:
• Assess which homes are sufficiently safe for families
to return to and subsequently encourage them to do
so; government estimates this will be —30% of all
homes/families (though this seems to be a guess, i.e., no
evidence base)
• Build semi-permanent settlements or augment pre-
existing villages around Port Au Prince where
feasible to enable the government to move people
out of settlements to those sites. End goal is to move
400-1000 families to each of these as needed
o Longer-term:
■ Rebuilt Port Au Prince though it is unclear how/if/why people
would move back or what the government's post-rebuild
vision looks like
■ Build more robust health, education etc systems than existed
before the earthquake
■ *Clearly this is the less well-defined part of the ""plan""

7333,"Senate Republicans Filibuster Fair Pay For Women
Matt Finkelstein
The first bill President Obama signed after taking office was the Lilly
Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which made it easier for women to seek justice for
pay discrimination. At the time, Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Kay Bailey
Hutchison (R-TX) and Olympia Snowe (R-ME) joined with Democrats to
overcome strong Republican opposition to the bill.
But today, all three Republican senators voted against a motion to
proceed on the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that ""would further
strengthen current laws against gender-based wage discrimination."" The
motion was defeated by a vote of 58-41, falling two votes short of the 60
needed for the bill to be considered on the Senate floor.
This is not the first time the Paycheck Fairness Act has stalled in the
Senate. In 2008, the upper chamber failed to vote on the bill after it was
approved by the House, which passed the legislation again in 2009 with
the support of 10 Republicans.
Women earn barely three-quarters of what their male counterparts make
for the same work, but conservatives have invented a number of
ludicrous reasons for opposing equal pay legislation. For example, the
Heritage Foundation has suggested that equal pay laws actually hurt
women because businesses simply won't hire them if they are required to
pay them fair wages. And Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) has claimed that
women would receive better compensation if they just had more
""education and training."""

aptember 26, 2010
John Rentoul: The party voted for David
Miliband but got the Panda instead
New Labour leader won't stand a chance against David
Cameron
The result is the worst possible for the Labour Party. A decisive victory for Ed Miliband would have been one thing. The
party would have made the wrong decision, but it would have done so with its eyes open and with the leader's legitimacy
unchallenged.
Instead, Ed Miliband lost the election in two parts of Labour's electoral college, among MPs and among Labour Party
members, but won thanks to a 60-40 margin the other way among trade union members on a very low turnout.
If he had won by a clear margin I would have said that Labour had chosen the Panda as its leader. He is soft, cuddly and
panders to every oppositional instinct in the party. There has been no position taken by the Labour government of which
he was a member that he was not prepared to trash if he thought Labour members would like it. Tuition fees, Iraq, the
third runway for Heathrow: you name it, he disowned it. Even, in the case of the third runway, a policy for which he had
direct ministerial responsibility. There has been no part of the manifesto, which he wrote, that he has not been prepared to
ditch.
But that is not what the party did. Labour Party members chose David Miliband. Labour MPs chose David. The party itself
voted for what Ed Miliband tried to dismiss as the ""New Labour Establishment"", in other words, the supposedly hated
Blairites. The party read the signals from the voters correctly. It knows that, although it didn't do as badly as it feared in the
general election, a lurch to the left was not the answer. Party members and MPs took on board Tony Blair's warning that
Labour lost because Gordon Brown ""moved a millimetre"" to the left of New Labour. They did not fall for the argument that
Labour did better than expected by moving a millimetre to the left and, therefore, to do better still they needed to move a
couple of centimetres further to the left.
They did not think that, because Labour has pulled level in the opinion polls, the next election is in the bag. They know
that the opposition party often moves ahead of the government in the opinion polls within months of an election. They also
know that Labour's poll rating is artificially inflated by the absence from the fray of the Liberal Democrats as a protest
party, and they know that this protest vote cannot be relied upon in a general election.
The Labour Party and Labour MPs got it right, and the election was won by an operation run by the trade union machines.
That means that Ed Miliband, who would have struggled against David Cameron in the House of Commons in any event,
is going to be roasted every week.
Every week, the Prime Minister is going to point out that the Leader of the Opposition does not have the support of the
members on the benches behind him. Not only that, he does not have the support of the members of his party in the
country. Every week, Cameron is going to portray Miliband as the place person of the trade union bosses and the
beneficiary of a boss-politics stitch-up.
If Ed Miliband had won the party members but lost among MPs, which is what I expected, the Conservatives would have
teased him in the Commons, but he would have had as much legitimacy as lain Duncan Smith - the choice of the party
activists against the wishes of his MPs. No wonder Ed was the ""cork-popper"" candidate in Conservative HQ. The way
things have turned out, that's not just a phrase; it would be worth lifting the austerity ban on bubbly for. David Cameron,
lucky general, faces an opponent with less of a mandate than IDS.
Even if Ed Miliband had won comfortably in all three sections of Labour's electoral college, I feel he would have struggled
against Cameron. This way, I fear that he fights with both hands tied behind his back."

7502,"Diplomacy Before and After Conflict
By Marc Grossman
Conflict is a universal condition,' older than diplomacy. While conflict is a constant in human
history, the nature of armed conflict, and especially the nature of 21st-century warfare, has been
transformed. General Rupert Smith identified these changes in his book The Utility of Force:
""The ends for which we fight are changing; we fight amongst the people; our conflicts tend to
be timeless; we fight so as not to lose the force; on each occasion new uses are found for old
weapons; the sides are mostly non-state.""2
The nature of 21st-century diplomacy is also changing. To be successful, diplomats must
simultaneously shape, act upon, and react to global challenges. As Hans Binnendijk and
Richard Kugler of the National Defense University argue, no single problem, danger, or threat
holds the key to the world's future. What matters is their interaction and the simultaneity of our
responses.3
The definition of victory, too, is different today. Twenty-first-century national security success
will encompass a comprehensive definition of security, and will be achieved by the broadest
simultaneous application of all elements of national power. This is the key to understanding
Philip Bobbitt's concept of ""preclusive victory,"" which he describes as ""anticipatory,
precautionary attention to possible futures,"" requiring an expansive and integrated approach to
modern diplomacy, defense, and development. A diplomatic strategy designed to produce
preclusive victory will include conflict prevention, successful negotiation, deterrence, the
preparation for conflict should all else fail, and efforts to establish order, ensure stability, and
promote political and economic pluralism after conflict.
Diplomats have always been participants in both the prevention and management of conflict and
its aftermath. The conflict prevention side of diplomacy occupied much of my time at the State
Department from 1993 to 1997 as the Department's Executive Secretary and U.S. Ambassador
to Turkey. Postconflict diplomacy was a defining issue of the last third of my career at State as
Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs and as Under Secretary of State for Political
Affairs from 2001 to 2005. I have tried to draw upon my experiences and observations to
discuss here the scope and complexity of modern diplomacy, the methods and goals needed to
prevent conflict, diplomacy's role when conflict is or seems to be unavoidable, and the
contribution diplomacy can make to restoring stability following conflict.
Diplomacy and Conflict Prevention
Thanks to the efforts of scholars and practitioners, we can now make better use of the methods
and theory of conflict prevention. The United States Institute of Peace and the Woodrow
Wilson International Center for Scholars are two among many institutions that have taken a
leadership role in these efforts. Michael Lund, a practitionerscholar, notes that the present
uncoordinated and patchy nature of preventive diplomacy reflects the absence of any accepted
international conflict prevention regime or system of governance—that is, of agreed upon
arrangements through which geographic jurisdictions are allocated, functional responsibilities
are assigned, norms and procedures are formulated, and actors are held accountable for their
responsibilities.' He asks the crucial question to all those who seek to ""coordinate and
rationalize"" a system of preventive diplomacy: where should responsibility for the tasks of
preventive action be located—early warning, the decision to act, the formulation of a response,
or the provision of bureaucratic and political support? Should it be horizontal, across different
organizations or actors, or should it be vertical, up or down their chains of command?6
An example of conflict prevention that meets Lund's tests was the effort undertaken by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), in close collaboration with the European Union
(EU) and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and supported by the
United States, to avoid civil war in Macedonia in 2001. It is difficult now to recall that, until
September 11, 2001, the possibility of civil war in Macedonia was a leading international
headline. This successful campaign of conflict prevention was defined by the remarkable
personal and institutional cooperation between the NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson
and the EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (and a former
NATO Secretary General) Javier Solana. I spoke often during this period to Lord Robertson,
Solana, and Ambassador James Pardew, whom President George W. Bush and Secretary Colin
Powell appointed as the U.S. representative to the effort and who, along with Francois Leotard,
the EU Special Envoy, played a crucial role in negotiating and implementing the Ohrid
Framework Agreement.
As a direct participant, senior NATO official Mark Laity stated that there are insights about
modern diplomacy and conflict prevention to be drawn from this effort, including the need for
personal and institutional teamwork, the importance of early engagement in trying to head off
violence, the need to choose the right people for tasks of this kind (including 21st-century
diplomats who can act ""unconventionally""), and the necessity of being able to apply appropriate
force quickly.'
Diplomacy When Conflict Is or Seems to Be Unavoidable
When diplomacy fails to prevent conflict, the role of the diplomat changes. The new
requirement may be to justify the use of force when all efforts to avoid conflict fail or to seek to
address the underlying source of conflict when force is or seems to be inevitable and
imperative.
The February 1999 diplomatic negotiations in Rambouillet, France, were designed to show the
world that NATO and the Contact Group were willing to make one last effort to avoid using
military force to stop Slobodan Milosevic's attacks in Kosovo. I was in Rambouillet as Assistant
Secretary of State for European Affairs to support Secretary Madeleine Albright. After the first
day or so of the meeting, there was so much chaos that I urged Secretary Albright to depart
Rambouillet and leave the ""negotiating"" to those of us more junior. My strategy was that by not
being present, the Secretary of State— and the administration—could keep a distance from an
outcome that might be unacceptable to the United States. The Secretary had a different vision.
Albright hoped Rambouillet would end the brutality against the Kosovars, but she was also
prepared for the meeting to fail, and thereby all options for avoiding military conflict would be
exhausted. Her idea was that we had to be seen to be doing everything we could diplomatically,
including her continued presence, so that if Rambouillet was a failure, there could be no further
excuses against taking military action.
Secretary of State James Baker had pursued a similar strategy before the first Gulf War in 1991.
Baker relates in his memoirs, The Politics of Diplomacy, that President George H.W. Bush had
concluded the United States should offer a meeting in Washington for Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz followed by a Baker trip to Baghdad to show America's commitment to avoiding
war if possible. Baker writes that he thought this proposal had three merits: it would give the
administration one last diplomatic opening to avoid war; it would shore up domestic support for
conflict; and it would show that, as the deadline for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait neared, the
administration was doing something other than just preparing for war. The President's offer
turned into the famous meeting between Baker and Aziz on January 9, 1991. As Baker recounts,
""I was under no illusions. I assumed the talks would be unsuccessful and that within a matter of
days, we would be at war.""8
In 2001-2003, the State Department leadership generally saw Iraq as a diversion from
Afghanistan and not central to the war on terror. Saddam Hussein was a dictator and a
menace— but ""in a box,"" posing no immediate, direct threat to the United States; focus should
be kept on defeating al Qaeda in Afghanistan and supporting the new Afghan government.9 Iraq
had been a source of tension and disagreement inside the State Department since the beginning
of the administration, and there were some who sought to move the policy from support for
""smart"" United Nations (UN) sanctions toward an aggressive posture against Saddam.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote in Years of Upheaval about the second term of the
Nixon administration that State Department culture emphasizes negotiability, which is a
consciousness of what the other side will accept.' Kissinger did not consider this trait a
particular positive at the time, and the department's culture of negotiability did not serve as a
good guide to institutional behavior for most of the senior State officials who participated in the
interagency debate leading to the invasion of Iraq. If that was so during the period surrounding
1970s détente with Russia, diplomatic efforts with the Shah of Iran, and the crisis in the Middle
East and the resulting 1973 war, this culture of negotiability no longer served as a good guide to
institutional behavior for most of the senior State officials who participated in the interagency
debate leading to the invasion of Iraq. We took part in planning for the conflict and its aftermath
assuming—or hoping—that events either at home or abroad would turn preparations for conflict
into successful coercive diplomacy rather than the military action that was ordered in the spring
of 2003.
The State Department's Director of Policy Planning, Richard Haass, observed that while he was
""60:40 against going to war. . . no organization could function if people left every time they
lost out on a 60:40 decision.""' Haass was operating under the belief that Iraq had weapons of
mass destruction; if he had known they did not, he says he would have been 90:10 against the
war.
And no senior Department of State officer resigned in protest. The department sought instead to
try to recreate the successful Gulf War coalition of President George H.W. Bush and argued that
the United States and its allies might compel Saddam to submit through a deployment of force
in the region in early 2003. If this failed, there should be a sustained diplomatic effort to create
a broad coalition to move militarily later in 2003. This possibility of a broad international
coalition lost all relevance on January 20, 2003, when the French government announced that it
would never support a second UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force in
Iraq.
Diplomacy in Preparation for Conflict
Once conflict is inevitable or is initiated, one job of diplomats is to support military
commanders in getting what they need to make conflict as short as possible, with the fewest
casualties for Americans, allies, and civilians. This was the objective that the United States
pursued in Turkey before the first Gulf War, which resulted in President Turgut Ozal's support
of American efforts. The diplomatic effort to prepare for conflict in Kosovo also involved the
whole of the U.S. Government and the governments of the NATO Allies. To pursue a
successful bombing campaign, diplomats in many NATO countries arranged for overflight and
support for Allied forces. A similar effort by U.S. diplomats took place before the invasion of
Afghanistan in 2001. American and allied diplomats worked closely with nations surrounding
Afghanistan, including forging contacts with Central Asian states on security issues for the first
time in order to achieve transit, overflight, and bed-down rights for American and coalition
forces before the October 7, 2001, beginning of action in Afghanistan.
Before the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, and especially after January 20, 2003, a similar
effort began in earnest. Diplomats supported U.S. Central Command commander General
Tommy Franks in order to make the war as short and successful as possible and to limit
American, allied, and Iraqi civilian casualties. American diplomats worked with military
commanders to seek access to facilities for U.S. forces and to participate in the public
diplomacy effort to gain as much support as possible for the armed liberation of Iraq. American
diplomats and Pentagon officials again paid particular attention to Turkey in an effort to
convince the Turks to allow the 4th Infantry Division to transit that country to create a northern
front in the battle against Saddam's forces. Although the State Department worried about the
size of the Department of Defense (DOD) request to Ankara, it worked closely with both
civilian and military authorities at the Pentagon to try to meet the need that had been identified
by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Joint DOD—State diplomacy, however, could not
overcome a negative vote in the Turkish parliament, which reflected strong public opposition to
the war.
The way the debate about using force is carried out inside the government influences attitudes
and actions during and after conflict as well as future decisions on whether or not to use force.
Military force may restore security, but it cannot resolve political or cultural sources of conflict.
As Rupert Smith writes, ""We are engaging in conflict for objectives that do not lead to a
resolution of the matter directly by force of arms, since at all but the most basic tactical level
our objectives tend to concern the intentions of the people and their leaders rather than their
territory or forces.""' Smith argues that the civil-military structure designed to make political-
military decisions is ""deeply problematic"" and distorts decisionmaking in many ways.13 In his
book, Smith imagines a debate between British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and
Ministry of Defense (MOD) officials about how to address the genocide taking place over a
number of weeks in Rwanda during the summer of 1994.
FCO: What can we do in the face of events in Rwanda?
MOD: What do you want us to do?
FCO: We ought to act. Something must be done. We can't have people being massacred. As a
permanent member of the UN Security Council we cannot be seen to be doing nothing.
MOD: So you want us to use military force?
FCO: Yes.
MOD: To do what? To stop the killing?
FCO: Yes. Exactly.
MOD: Who do you want us to fight? We are not clear who is doing the killing: is it tribe on
tribe, or is it a force found _from a tribe? And Rwanda is a big country. Where do we start?
Kigali, presumably, it's the capital and we would want an airhead.
FCO: Well, there must be an international force, of course.
MOD: And what would be the British aim in joining the force?
FCO: To play our part as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
MOD: Is Britain to lead the force?
FCO: No, it should be led by the UN—a proper UN mission.
MOD: That will take some time to assemble, so it will probably be too late to stop the killing.
FCO: Then the mission should be aimed at bringing postconflict order.
MOD: OK But we need to be clear how many British troops are currently available. Given our
deployments in Ireland, Bosnia and a few other places, not many.
FCO: What do you suggest?
MOD: What are our government's priorities? Is contributing to this force a higher priority than
these other tasks we are already undertaking?
FCO: Probably not.
MOD: In that case, these UN forces always lack expeditionary logistic support. And if we want
to speed up the deployment of this force, offering a logistic unit would probably be the most
valuable contribution.
FCO: Will that put our soldiers at risk?
MOD: Hardly any.""
Many American diplomats will recognize this imaginary conversation, having participated in
something like it dozens of times since the fall of the Berlin Wall. In the American debate, the
issue also quickly focuses on who pays the bills. It is worth stating, at least in the American
case, that officials at the Pentagon and DOD often were legitimately frustrated by the State
Department's inclination to promote military missions for the Pentagon and the Armed Forces
in an increasing number of situations that were important, but not vital, to U.S. national
interests. While this readiness to volunteer U.S. military forces to solve problems around the
world was a direct result of the lack of civilian capacity to do the jobs required, it leads to
understandable consternation among those in uniform.
Diplomacy and Restoring Stability Following Conflict
There are many issues—defeating extremism, promoting pluralism, bringing the benefits of
globalization to those who have not yet benefited, living sustainably on the planet,
nonproliferation— that will be part of any definition of successful 21st-century diplomacy. But
getting postconflict diplomacy right—creating the conditions for a preclusive victory—may be
the most crucial of all. This is not an easy assignment. The concept of success can be redefined
after the fact, further complicating the assessment. Successful democratic governance and
economic development cannot be delivered on a certain date, and therefore the need for time
and patience is a necessity on the ground. However, patience is limited in home countries, and
""fatigue"" often sets in. Thus, the potential for failure is high. Industrial war produced winners
and losers; today's lines are not so clearly drawn, and the timeline may be longer.
Rupert Smith again brings clarity to this assessment:
We intervene in or even decide to escalate to, a conflict in order to establish a condition in
which the political objective can be achieved by other means and in other ways. We seek to
create a conceptual space for diplomacy, economic incentives, political pressure and other
measures to create a desired political outcome of stability, and if possible democracy. . . . if a
decisive strategic victory was the hallmark of interstate industrial war, establishing a condition
may be deemed a hallmark of the new paradigm of war amongst the people.15
Smith's point can be pressed even further by recognizing the additional distinction between a
military operation carried out following Smith's rules and the ambiguity inherent in trying to
create the conditions Smith identifies as objectives. Christopher Schnaubelt has noted that a
typical military operation will have unambiguous geographic boundaries (areas of
responsibility) and will assign specific units to be responsible for every inch of ground or cubic
foot of airspace. There is an obvious chain of responsibilities and expected actions between
each individual Soldier or Marine on the ground and the commanding general. Nothing
comparable exists for economic development in governance tasks, which tend to be assigned by
function rather than local geography or rigid hierarchy of authority.16
Postconflict diplomacy was among the defining diplomatic issues of the last third of my career
at the State Department.
In the aftermath of the first Gulf War in 1991, almost 500,000 Kurds fled to the mountains
between Iraq and Turkey. Stranded in harsh conditions, they began to starve by the thousands
each day. I was then the Deputy Chief of Mission in Turkey. Inspired by the leadership of
Ambassador Morton Abramowitz, American diplomats, followed by American military forces
and then an international coalition of governments and nongovernmental organizations, initiated
Operation Provide Comfort (which became Operation Northern Watch). This was not just a
""whole-of-government"" but a ""whole-of-theinternational- community"" campaign to provide
humanitarian assistance and then return the Kurds to their homes in Northern Iraq. Once home,
they needed to be protected, and for 11 years, the United Sates and some of its allies, including
Turkey, worked on the ground there to recreate a functioning society and then protected this
area from Saddam by enforcing a no-fly zone.
These years were also punctuated by activity in the Balkans. As Richard Holbrooke recounts,
some of the pre-Dayton negotiations with Bosnian leader Alija Izetbegovi took place in my
residence while I was Ambassador to Turkey:7 As one of Holbrooke's successors as Assistant
Secretary for European Affairs, I watched the effort made by Ambassadors Robert Gelbard and
James Dobbins to implement the Dayton Accords by applying whole-of-government efforts in
postconflict post- Yugoslavia. I picked up the diplomatic thread again as Under Secretary of
State for Political Affairs promoting reconciliation, development, political progress, and
nationbuilding in Kosovo.
Other postconflict diplomacy efforts in Haiti, East Timor, and Liberia called upon the resources
of the United States and other governments to try to create the conceptual space for
development and sustained peace. The U.S. effort in Colombia, too, highlighted the need to
focus on an integrated and cross-sectoral approach, which included disarmament,
demobilization, and reintegration of former combatants and promoted justice in postconflict
society. But the main events in modern diplomacy's postconflict paradigm are Afghanistan and
Iraq.
The key to understanding U.S. diplomacy in postconflict Afghanistan and Iraq is to recall the
profound disagreement inside the U.S. Government, especially between DOD and State, about
whether the United States should engage in ""nationbuilding,"" a policy President Bush had
campaigned against in 2000. State Department professionals were generally proud of the effort
the United States had made in nationbuilding and in peacekeeping, supporting the deployment
of U.S. military forces to participate, for example, in the Multinational Force and Observers in
the Sinai and in peacekeeping and nationbuilding activities in East Timor, Haiti, and the
Balkans. Most believed that nationbuilding, properly funded and executed, was an effective
long-term tool of integrated modern diplomacy for the United States.
The effort to create a new Afghan government after the overthrow of the Taliban was a piece of
classical diplomacy carried out in the 21st-century context.'8 Secretary Powell directed
Ambassador Dobbins to support the regional negotiation hosted by the Germans in Bonn in
2001 to create a new Afghan government. To succeed, Dobbins worked with all the key players,
including representatives from Iran, to support a major role for the United Nations and put
Hamid Karzai in position to lead a new Afghanistan.' But, as Dobbins has written, the ""Bush
Administration, having overthrown the Taliban and installed a new government in Kabul,
determined that American troops would do no peacekeeping and that peacekeepers from other
countries would not be allowed to venture beyond the Kabul city limits. Public security
throughout the rest of the country would be left entirely to Afghans, despite the fact that
Afghanistan had no army and no police force.""2°
The struggle over nationbuilding also hampered American attempts to get sufficient amounts of
U.S. or international assistance to Afghanistan. Washington accepted the diffusion of
responsibility there, with the British taking charge of counternarcotics, the Italians reforming
the justice sector, and the Germans training police. This satisfied the need for burden-sharing
but did not lead to success. In addition, postconflict resources focused by the United States on
Afghanistan were small compared to other recent postconflict situations, even including
Kosovo.' American diplomats who followed Dobbins to the Embassy in Kabul over the years
faced the legacy of this lack of attention and underinvestment.22
The State Department participated at many levels in the National Security Council—led planning
for postconflict Iraq. Much of the planning was detailed, but focused on lessons learned from
the first Gulf War. The department's Future of Iraq Project, while important, would not have
solved Iraq's postwar problems. State did not have the capacity to take responsibility for the
immediate postconflict administration of Iraq, and its leadership agreed to the Executive order
creating a postconflict Iraq structure that reported to the Secretary of Defense.
There is no need here to recount the lost lives and lost opportunities so well chronicled by
others in the immediate postconflict period in Iraq, although Dobbins's argument that, looking
back, the Coalition Provisional Authority accomplished a great deal under trying circumstances
is worth noting.23 On July 1, 2004, the State Department did officially open (on time and on
budget) an Embassy in Baghdad, which allowed an expansion of diplomacy and led to more
comprehensive senior civilian-military cooperation.
There is another important lesson to draw from recent postconflict efforts: the need to have
adequate civilian capacity to respond, including a role for a revitalized U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID). As this journal chronicled in an article' by Ambassador
John Herbst, the Secretary of State's Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS),
his office was mandated to develop a whole-ofgovernment civilian response to stability
operations and to ensure civilian-military coordination.
The Civilian Response Corps (CRC) is in an early stage, and ultimately will be made up of a
reserve component, in addition to the existing active and standby components. The personnel
are anticipated to represent the full range of sector experts: engineers, lawyers, judges,
corrections officials, diplomats, development experts, public administrators, public health
officials, city planners, border control officials, economists, and others. Currently, the active
and standby components that are being stepped up are drawn from State, USAID, and a core
group of domestic U.S. Agencies.
Once congressionally funded, the reserves would be drawn from state and local governments
and the private sector. Between January 2008 and May 2009, 56 CRC members deployed to 11
countries, including Afghanistan for planning purposes, and there are realistic plans to have 250
active members and 1,000 standby members ready to deploy by the end of 2010. There are now
at least 14 other countries with whom the United States allies that have a civilian peacebuilding
capacity—some including stability or civilian police, and employing wholeof- government or
""comprehensive"" approaches similar to that created by Washington. Several, in fact, have
higher budgets proportionate to their gross national products than America's.25
One way for State to further support the S/CRS effort would be to consider creating a new
personnel specialty: the ""expeditionary diplomat."" Washington's diplomatic personnel have, of
course, always been in one sense expeditionary; the majority of the Foreign Service is deployed
abroad the majority of the time. But the post-9/11 diplomatic experience, and especially the
effort in Iraq and Afghanistan, means that State needs to be more explicit about the
expeditionary nature of some of its future diplomatic work and should prepare a small but
significant number of people to serve successfully in the hardest places at a moment's notice.
Experience with the Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Iraq and Afghanistan, the lessons
learned with S/CRS, and the example of diplomats who have pursued careers in the toughest
posts should lead State leadership to conclude that this is a step worth taking. The first
requirement would be advanced training, some of it provided by DOD and some by the Central
Intelligence Agency, for those entering diplomats who believe they want to pursue this special
career path. These entering officers would make an explicit choice and understand that an
investment in their extra training would require their service in hard places, just as we now ask
diplomats who take the hardest languages— Chinese or Arabic, for example—to serve more
than one tour using their skills. Since these expeditionary diplomats will not need to meet the
same age and physical requirements as special operations in the military, the State Department
could allow people to opt in and out of this ""special force"" during their careers as long as they
have the proper training. This would allow flexibility across the institution and encourage those
who desire or whose family circumstances might change over time to participate as well. The
department would also need to make sure those taking this career path are recognized for a
career beyond the norm for Foreign Service and are promoted and rewarded.
The creation of S/CRS is a symbol of the comprehensive, simultaneous diplomacy needed for
the future, and this expeditionary diplomat could form the backbone of the State and USAID
commitment to the civilian response capacity. There are still key questions to be answered
about civilian capacity. In the face of a real world situation, will DOD really support a State
Department—led operation? Will Congress adequately fund S/CRS, including a reasonable
contingency fund? How will S/CRS and a resurgent USAID work together? Where will the
lines be drawn between immediate postconflict needs and nationbuilding? There seems to be no
question that the path is the right one, consistent with the administration's focus on diplomacy,
development, and defense. Success will come with clear direction and active implementation.
If we combine the observations made by several authors,' we arrive at this question: What
national policies, supported by adequate human and financial resources, will create the
conditions during and after war to bring about a preclusive victory? Nation building, post-
conflict reconstruction and stability operations, and counterinsurgency strategy (call it what we
will) will be part of modern diplomacy for years to come. Accomplishing this task does not
have to be an exclusively American responsibility, and, indeed, one of the goals of modern
American diplomats will be to make these efforts more international. But for the foreseeable
future, the United States will need to learn the lessons of its role in nation building from
Germany to Iraq."" These lessons include support for new institutions that bring all of the
elements of power and influence together in the same theater, at the same time, and in close
coordination so the United States and its allies and friends have a chance to succeed.28 As Philip
Bobbitt has written, ""The problem is the picture of warfare to which we cling. This picture
unfolds in this way: peace making by diplomats; war making by the Armed Forces; peace
building by [US]AID and reconstruction personnel. The reality of 21st century warfare,
however, is that all of these tasks must be performed simultaneously.""'
While the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century can be observed and analyzed
individually, none of them can be solved without reference to the others. Diplomacy is not the
answer to every question, but it has utility both before and after conflict. As General Smith
writes at the end of his volume:
For the general purpose of all interventions is clear: we seek to establish in the minds of the
people and their leaders that the ever present option of conflict is not the preferable course of
action when in confrontation over some matter or another. This applies as much to the state
possessing nuclear weapons or seeking to obtain them, rogue or otherwise, as it does to the *
terrorist or the machete-wielding rebel; each is posing an armed threat to people to establish a
condition in which to achieve its political goal. To do this, military force is a valid option, a
lever of intervention and influence, as much as economic, political and diplomatic levers, but to
be effective it must be applied as apart of a greater scheme focusing all measures on the one
goal.3°
The connection to the utility of a modern diplomacy is clear. Twenty-first-century diplomacy,
working to prevent conflict, trying to get ready for it if it is inevitable, or dealing with the
consequences, can be an effective tool of national security if it is adequately funded, carried out
by well-trained, dedicated people, focused on clear goals set by national leaders, and backed by
effective military force. This is the diplomacy of the future.
The author expresses appreciation to The Cohen Group for allowing him time to consider

Harvard John F. Kennedy School Project on Diplomacy for supporting the effort. The
author also gratefully acknowledges the important contributions of Toni Getze, Jill
O'Donnell, and Daniel Bliss in making this article a reality.

Thanks a lot for all the good wishes you have sent via Lois. It has been one of the pleasures of the last few months to see
you going from strength to strength. And the wedding looked fantastic!
Your message on Saturday was poignant. Losing is tough. When you win the party members and MPs doubly so. (When
it's your brother...). But I am so proud of the campaign we ran, the issues we raised etc. We got people to believe in a
New Labour platform - and modernised the platform.
I have announced today that I will stay in Parliament but not in shadow cabinet.
Thanks for all your encouragement over the last couple of years. I will let you know when I am in DC.
All best,

7546,"Jake probably passed this on to you, but just in case, I think it's definitely worth reading
A few comments from one of my staff members who has long experience with
the Middle East follow.
From Martin: The principle conclusion from a quick visit to Israel and Ramallah over the weekend is that
Netanyahu is in a strong position politically, with an unusually stable ruling coalition. Nobody I spoke with
believed that the government would have fallen if he had decided to extend the settlement freeze before its
expiry, as a gesture to U.S. peacemaking efforts. In their view, he could have easily garnered the support of a
large majority of the people, for whom the settlers are a marginal concern. And this would have given him
leverage over his ministers to ensure their support or abstention in the cabinet. As Dan Meridor noted, Likud
voters are to the left of their Knesset members when it comes to peacemaking (70 percent support the two-state
solution, vs only 50 percent of the leadership).
Lieberman, not the Likud, is Bibi's chief concern. He wants to keep him in the government for as long as
possible for fear that when he leaves he will garner the support of those on the right, including from the Likud,
who oppose peacemaking. For the time being, Bibi uses the threat of an alternative coalition with Kadima to
keep Lieberman in the tent. But the clock is ticking. According to Tzipi Livni, she can bring her party into the
government now, and is willing to do so without any demand for ""rotation,"" provided Bibi is serious about
negotiating peace. But as the elections grow closer, more and more of her party members are turning against
the idea of joining the government. They are strengthened in their views by recent internal polling which shows
Kadima with 32 seats (up from 28 now), Likud slightly down at 25, and Labor at only 5.
Therefore, if Bibi intends to make a deal with Abu Mazen, he will need to do so sooner rather than later. The
longer he waits, the less leverage he has on Lieberman and the more likely Lieberman will break away to
oppose him in the next elections.
In this context, Bibi's negotiating tactics become self-defeating. Believing that he is a great negotiator, and that
he is operating in the Middle East bazaar, he inflates his requirements well beyond anything reasonable in the
belief that this is the best way to secure the highest price. The process of bringing him down to a reasonable
price uses up a lot of energy, uses up a lot of goodwill, humiliates his Palestinian negotiating partner, and raises
doubts about his seriousness. In the end, under great pressure from all quarters, he will make the final
concession, but only after wasting a lot of time, making everybody furious with him, and thereby securing no
credit either with his supporters or negotiating partners. At heart, he seems to lack a generosity of spirit. This
combines with his legendary fear of being seen as a ""freier"" (sucker) in front of his people to create a real
problem in the negotiations, especially because he holds most of the cards.
This is further complicated by his introduction of the notion of ""creative ideas."" Thinking out of the box, as he
likes to do, will only further delay the negotiations because the box is already well-defined. To attempt to
broaden the parameters will generate mistrust of his intentions on the Palestinian side just when direct
negotiations provide the opportunity to build trust.
The reason for dwelling on Bibi's psychology rather than his politics is that the latter all point in the direction of
making a deal: the Israeli public is ready to get on with it; if Israel doesn't make a serious move, it will further
delegitimize its standing internationally (something Bibi is deeply concerned about); Bibi needs President
Obama in his corner to deal with the threat from Iran and to avoid punishment by the voters for mishandling
relations with the U.S.; and if he doesn't make the deal with Abu Mazen now, he will have helped to advance
the future he is most concerned about - a llamas takeover of the Palestinian leadership.
Yuval Diskin was quite clear about this latter point. After praising the Palestinian security services to the sky
(unusual for him) he told me that he had warned Bibi that at the moment they have a high motivation to prevent
terror because they believe they are building their state. If that proves to be an illusion, the motivation will
disappear and then he cannot guarantee security in the West Bank. He considers it quite possible that if Bibi
doesn't quickly demonstrate his seriousness to Abu Mazen, he will resign because his honor has now been
seriously damaged. He told Bibi that he cannot predict who will lead the Palestinians if Abu Mazen resigns, but
that Salam Fayyad will likely have to go too.
What is to be done? I have no magic solution for what must be a deeply frustrating exercise for you. And
please forgive me if what I recommend here is just repeating what you already know.
1.Put your arm around Bibi: he still thinks we are out to bring him down. There is no substitute for working
with him, even though he makes it such a frustrating process. But the purpose of embracing him is to nudge
him forward, not to buy into his exaggerated political fears or accept his inflated demands.
2. Try to find a way to make him understand that his negotiating tactics are counterproductive to his own
purposes. The Obama Administration has done a great deal lately to underscore its concern for Israel's security,
from the vote at the IAEA, to the sanctions on Iran, to the letter that Obama was willing to sign that accepted
Bibi's security requirements. That should buy you credibility with him.
3. As his friend, paint a realistic picture of the strategic consequences of his negotiating tactics, particularly in
terms of what is likely to happen to the PA leadership if he worries only about his politics and not at all about
Abu Mazen's politics.
4. If all else fails, avoid recriminations in favor of a ""clarifying moment."" The world will of course blame
Bibi. But you should avoid any kind of finger-pointing in favor of a repeated commitment to a negotiated
solution and a willingness to engage with both sides in trying to make that happen, when they're ready. The
Israeli public and the American Jewish Community should know how far the President was prepared to go and
they should be allowed to draw their own conclusions. Bibi, Abu Mazen, and the Arab states need negotiations
and time is not on the side of any of them. They will come back to the table sooner rather than later as long as
we keep the door open.

With prodigious efforts by your entire team (Jeanne, Dana, and Ed Meier worked very hard with Pat and his people over
the past week on the last chapter in addition to Bill, Karen, both Jim and Don Steinberg and others at both State and
USAID), greatly aided by spectacular thinking and all-night editing from Jake, here are a much improved four chapters.
Among other things, the 4th chapter now showcases much of the great work jack and his team have already done.
In the final report we will have
1.An introductory 1-2 page letter from you
2. An exec summary (10-15 pp that can be read in lieu of entire doc)
3. An introduction framing the chapters in terms of leading thru civilian power;
4. A chapter on the global trends and policies driving our assessment of the capabilities we need (written but not yet
edited):
5. the attached 4 chapters;
6. a final chapter on the National Security Budget;
7. A conclusion.
With the edits/cuts this week we are on track to come in some 5,000-10,000 words shorter than the QDR.

vision for diplomacy
By Elise Labatt, CNN
October 27, 2010 12:51 p.m. EDT
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
• It is the first-ever undertaking for the State Department
• Approach will focus on American leadership through civilian power
• Going forward, diplomats likely to wear cargo pants as a pinstriped suit.
Washington (CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is outlining how she plans to redefine U.S. diplomacy and
development ahead of a top-down review which has taken place this year and will be released in the coming weeks.
In an essay in the November/December issue of Foreign Affairs, Clinton previews the Quadrennial Diplomacy and
Development Review, commonly referred to as the QDDR. The review, the first-ever such an undertaking for the
State Department, is meant to balance a similar quadrennial review by the Defense Department that projects their
strategy and priorities.
The new approach to development, Clinton says, will focus on American leadership through civilian power. Both
Clinton and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and have talked about ""demilitarizing"" foreign policy, and Clinton
says the QDDR will suggest how to do that, with a whole new set of resources for diplomacy and development,
much of which will be geared toward fragile states in conflict or crisis.
In the article, Clinton painted the broad strokes of the document, which she called a blueprint for reforms to be
implemented over the next four years. Those reforms include modernizing and coordinating diplomacy across U.S.
government agencies, creating a stronger nexus between diplomacy and development and ensuring that
development undertaken by the U.S. has a lasting and ""sustainable"" impact.
""Economic growth is the surest route out of poverty, and expanding and strengthening middle classes around the
world will be key to creating the just and sustainable international order that lies at the heart of the United States'
national security strategy,"" Clinton wrote in Foreign Affairs. She said that the U.S. ultimate goal in development was
to ""put itself out of business"" by boosting up countries to assume responsibility for their own projects and future.
President Barack Obama laid out the vision and the basic pillars of the policy in September at the United Nations
General Assembly when he released the ""U.S. Global Development Policy,"" which changes U.S. efforts to focus on
building up countries that demonstrate good governance and economic potential.
But the QDDR will outline how to put that policy into practice. Officials say the 150-page document will detail
everything from how the United States conducts multilateral diplomacy, how the United States undertakes
""stabilization"" efforts in post-conflict areas, how the State Department works with USAID and contractors to the
types and numbers of personnel needed to implement the new approach.
American diplomats going forward, Clinton said, are as likely to wear cargo pants as a pinstriped suit."

Wiki Leaks Accidentally Helps U.S.
by Leslie H. Gelb
November 30, 2010 I 10:42pm
Julian Assange clearly intended the State Dept. cable leaks to smear the U.S. as evil and selfish. Leslie
H. Gelb on how he inadvertently proved the opposite.
The Wikileakers dumped a vast pile of secrets to prove that the United States was selfish, stupid and wicked—but their
revelations proved just the opposite. When you remove the gossip and obvious trivia that mesmerized the press, you
clearly see what the Wikileakers never expected: A United States seriously and professionally trying to solve the most
dangerous problems in a frighteningly complicated world, yet lacking the power to dictate solutions. U.S. policymakers
and diplomats are shown, quite accurately, doing what they are supposed to do: ferreting out critical information from
foreign leaders, searching for paths to common action, and struggling with the right amount of pressure to apply on allies
and adversaries. And in most cases, the villain is not Washington, but foreign leaders escaping common action with
cowardice and hypocrisy.
Don't think for a New York minute that Julian Assange, the Wikileaker, unloaded this trove to save humankind. Why did he
toss in those cables about Italy's leader being a rake and Germany's chancellor being a cautious fuddy-duddy, and
President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan being ""paranoid""? To save the world? Not a chance. He did it to get attention, and
he got attention from a drooling press, which then went on to call the very material they were highlighting trivial. Did
Assange leak critical conversations with Chinese or Arab leaders to help solve the problems in Korea and Iran? Not by the
hair on your chinny chin chin. He did it to show that he could do it—and for the attention. Anyone who is not a hopeless
left-wing ideologue knows that such leaks will crush future serious conversations with those leaders for some time to
come. Just think: if you told someone a serious and critical confidence about someone else, and your confidant went out
and told others, would you soon repeat that mistake? Assange did not leak these cables to help solve world problems.
These leaks were absolutely gratuitous and served only the purpose of making him a media marvel.
When you actually read the cables, here's what you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucial
world In explaining his deed publicly, Assange suggests that what he's doing is uncovering American misdeeds and lies.
His aim, he says, is to inform citizens of democracies and peoples around the world about what their leaders are really
doing. Assange also insists he did this for transparency's sake. Yet when he got to look inside, he didn't see what was
plain: that our diplomats were doing a good job. Indeed, when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strange
commentary on cable news and even on the front pages of great newspapers, when you actually read the cables, here's
what you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucial world problems.
But when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strange commentary on cable news and even on the front

diplomats trying to solve crucial world problems.
—Washington needs China's help in bolstering sanctions against Iran, and China balks for fear of jeopardizing its oil and
gas flow from that country. The Obama team arranges for Saudi Arabia to guarantee any loss in supply to China. If the
world wants to slow or even prevent Iran's march to nuclear weaponry, this is a key path to doing so.
—
The U.S. discovers that North Korea has manufactured new medium-range missiles and is trying to deliver them to Iran
through China. The Obama team discovers this, informs Beijing, and asks Beijing to stop the transfer. Beijing declines.
Really creepy.
—
Yemen's leader takes public responsibility for American missile attacks against Al Qaeda in Yemen. He wants to
diminish the power of these terrorists, as do Americans and most others in the world. The ""lie"" by the Yemeni president is
a harmless way to get a critical job done—that is, the job of fighting international terrorism. Wikileaks tears away the
political cover of Yemen's leaders.
—No country has anywhere near as much influence over nutty North Korea as China. So, U.S. diplomats are searching
desperately to figure out Chinese thinking about North Korea in order to compose a plan for avoiding war on the Korean
Peninsula. So, the Wikileakers expose some Chinese leaders who are actually trying to give us some insight into Chinese
thinking about North Korean craziness. They won't do that again soon.
Time and again, as one actually reads these cables, one has to be heartened by the professionalism and the insights of
U.S. diplomats. What are they doing? They are not lying, and U.S. leaders are not lying. They are actually, believe it or
not, trying to solve problems. That seriousness of purpose and the professionalism to execute it is what jumps out at you
in these materials.
So, the naïve say, it's good to show the effectiveness of our diplomats. Give me a break. Ask any American diplomat to
choose between looking intelligent in leaked cables and making progress toward avoiding war.
None of this is to say that there should not be leaks, or that the press should not pursue classified information that is
necessary or very helpful to a sensible public debate on policy. If a U.S. administration is lying, or distorting the facts, or
telling one story to the public and another to itself, then by all means, let's have it out in public. If the U.S. government is
concocting intelligence in order to justify wars, let's hope an enterprising reporter finds it out for the rest of us.
But the Wikileaks dump is not about providing essential information to Americans or to others—information they need for
serious policy discussion. This massive trashing by Wikileaks of a legitimate effort by the U.S. government to preserve
confidentiality is the very least a shame and at the most, a crime.

The Republican case for ratifying New START
bn)://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/01/AR2010120104598.html?hpid=topnews
By Henry A. Kissinger, George P. Shultz, James A. Baker III, Lawrence S. Eagleburger and Colin L. Powell
Thursday, December 2, 2010;
Republican presidents have long led the crucial fight to protect the United States against nuclear dangers. That
is why Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush negotiated the SALT I, START I and
START II agreements. It is why President George W. Bush negotiated the Moscow Treaty. All four recognized
that reducing the number of nuclear arms in an open, verifiable manner would reduce the risk of nuclear
catastrophe and increase the stability of America's relationship with the Soviet Union and, later, the Russian
Federation. The world is safer today because of the decades-long effort to reduce its supply of nuclear weapons.
As a result, we urge the Senate to ratify the New START treaty signed by President Obama and Russian
President Dmitry Medvedev. It is a modest and appropriate continuation of the START I treaty that expired
almost a year ago. It reduces the number of nuclear weapons that each side deploys while enabling the United
States to maintain a strong nuclear deterrent and preserving the flexibility to deploy those forces as we see fit.
Along with our obligation to protect the homeland, the United States has responsibilities to allies around the
world. The commander of our nuclear forces has testified that the 1,550 warheads allowed under this treaty are
sufficient for all our missions - and seven former nuclear commanders agree. The defense secretary, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the head of the Missile Defense Agency - all originally appointed by a
Republican president - argue that New START is essential for our national defense.
We do not make a recommendation about the exact timing of a Senate ratification vote. That is a matter for the
administration and Senate leaders. The most important thing is to have bipartisan support for the treaty, as
previous nuclear arms treaties did.
Although each of us had initial questions about New START, administration officials have provided reasonable
answers. We believe there are compelling reasons Republicans should support ratification.
First, the agreement emphasizes verification, providing a valuable window into Russia's nuclear arsenal. Since
the original START expired last December, Russia has not been required to provide notifications about changes
in its strategic nuclear arsenal, and the United States has been unable to conduct on-site inspections. Each day,
America's understanding of Russia's arsenal has been degraded, and resources have been diverted from national
security tasks to try to fill the gaps. Our military planners increasingly lack the best possible insight into
Russia's activity with its strategic nuclear arsenal, making it more difficult to carry out their nuclear deterrent
mission.
Second, New START preserves our ability to deploy effective missile defenses. The testimonies of our military
commanders and civilian leaders make clear that the treaty does not limit U.S. missile defense plans. Although
the treaty prohibits the conversion of existing launchers for intercontinental and submarine-based ballistic
missiles, our military leaders say they do not want to do that because it is more expensive and less effective than
building new ones for defense purposes.
Finally, the Obama administration has agreed to provide for modernization of the infrastructure essential to
maintaining our nuclear arsenal. Funding these efforts has become part of the negotiations in the ratification
process. The administration has put forth a 10-year plan to spend $84 billion on the Energy Department's
nuclear weapons complex. Much of the credit for getting the administration to add $14 billion to the originally
proposed $70 billion for modernization goes to Sen. Jon Kyl, the Arizona Republican who has been vigilant in
this effort. Implementing this modernization program in a timely fashion would be important in ensuring that
our nuclear arsenal is maintained appropriately over the next decade and beyond.
Although the United States needs a strong and reliable nuclear force, the chief nuclear danger today comes not
from Russia but from rogue states such as Iran and North Korea and the potential for nuclear material to fall
into the hands of terrorists. Given those pressing dangers, some question why an arms control treaty with Russia
matters. It matters because it is in both parties' interest that there be transparency and stability in their strategic
nuclear relationship. It also matters because Russia's cooperation will be needed if we are to make progress in
rolling back the Iranian and North Korean programs. Russian help will be needed to continue our work to
secure ""loose nukes"" in Russia and elsewhere. And Russian assistance is needed to improve the situation in
Afghanistan, a breeding ground for international terrorism.
Obviously, the United States does not sign arms control agreements just to make friends. Any treaty must be
considered on its merits. But we have here an agreement that is clearly in our national interest, and we should
consider the ramifications of not ratifying it.
Whenever New START is brought up for debate, we encourage all senators to focus on national security. There
are plenty of opportunities to battle on domestic political issues linked to the future of the American economy.
With our country facing the dual threats of unemployment and a growing federal debt bomb, we anticipate
significant conflict between Democrats and Republicans. It is, however, in the national interest to ratify New
START.

American Diplomacy Revealed as Good
By ROGER COHEN
NEW YORK — Let's hear it for the men and women of the U.S. Foreign Service!
They are, to judge from the WikiLeaks dump of a quarter-million of their private or secret cables, thoughtful, well-informed
and dedicated servants of the American interest who write clear, declarative English sentences.
I've not heard much in the torrent of Wiki-chatter about these admirable career diplomats whose diplomacy is now
condemned to be unquiet. Yet it is they whose lives have been upturned. Every journalist knows that if their
correspondence over several years was suddenly made public, they would lose most of their sources. That should give
every journalist pause.
So it will be on the front line of U.S. diplomacy. Contacts will self-censor. They will go quiet, particularly in the more
conspiratorial parts of the world which also tend to be the most unstable, like the Middle East. Layers of secrecy will be
added.
Julian Assange, the thin-skinned founder of WikiLeaks, has hurt U.S. interests across a broad but probably shallow
spectrum. That will satisfy him in that he's a self-styled foe of the United States. The guy makes me queasy.
Perhaps the most shocking thing about the Assange treasure trove — beyond the ""shock"" of venal Gulf Arab Sunni
leaders looking for war on the cheap against Shiite Iran so long as it doesn't disrupt their U.S.-armed fiefdoms; or the
""shock"" of Pakistani double-dealing and nuclear procrastination; or the ""shock"" of yet more premature Israeli predictions
on when Iran will have a nuclear weapon; or the ""shock"" of continued Saudi funding of Al Qaeda; or the ""shock"" of the
Chinese Politburo hacking into Google; or the ""shock"" of Muammar el-Qaddafi's taste for voluptuous Slavic women and
Silvio Berlusconi's taste for all women — perhaps the biggest shock of all is just how professional, sober and short on
embarrassment all these cables are and just how much they conform with the world as we already knew it, right down to
the familiar adjectives evoking French President Nicolas Sarkozy: ""hyperactive,"" ""mercurial,"" ""authoritarian,"" ""erratic,""
""monarch-like.""
I swear, if they hadn't become diplomats a lot of these State Department people could have become good hacks.
Overall, my longstanding admiration for America's conscientious diplomats has been redoubled, not least for this
underreported nugget on the turbulent Iranian election of 2009, contained in a cable of Jan. 12, 2010, from Dubai: ""While
we don't know nor might not ever know the real June 12 vote count, it is clear that the turnout was at record high levels
and that there was systematic vote count fraud (if in fact the votes were even counted) to ensure that Ahmadinejad 'won
big' in the first round.""
It is good to know that this is the innermost conviction of American diplomacy: the fraud was evident to anyone in Tehran
during the election and its violent aftermath.
A couple more observations on Iran: The first is that the Sunni autocrats of the Gulf are as exercised as they are about
Tehran in part because they know that any U.S.-Iranian breakthrough might make them more dispensable to the United
States. Their vested interest in the prevailing Middle Eastern strategic equation is strong; nothing would redraw the Middle
East more than overcoming the U.S.-Iranian psychosis.
The second is that President Barack Obama's approach to Iran has been much more conventional than his initial outreach
suggested. Old habits of attempted coercion trumped originality. Very quickly he fell back on Dennis Ross's tired thinking
about balancing ""appetizing carrots"" with ""sharp sticks"" in tackling Iran's nuclear program.
The cables reveal that as early as March 2009, a senior U.S. diplomat was talking ""dual track,"" telling Europeans that
""engagement alone is unlikely to succeed"" and calling for added ""pressure."" Perhaps Iranian skepticism could never have
been overcome; certainly this approach guaranteed longstanding Iranian grievances would fester.
Assange himself clearly understands nothing of Iran or the Middle East or diplomacy. In an interview with Time, he
expressed approval for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ""coming out with a very interesting statement that
leaders should speak in public like they do in private whenever they can"" and bought into Netanyahu's view that this, in
Assange's words, would ""lead to some kind of increase in the peace process in the Middle East and particularly in relation
to Iran.
It
Huh? Netanyahu was referring to Arab leaders' now-documented private calls for a U.S.-led war against Iran, an option he
also favors. And that, for Assange, is a step forward to peace! He's all over the place.
What should we make of this brainy naïf who told my colleague John Burns that America is a threat to democracy? He's a
loose canon; let him be. My impression is he's self-armed with a spade and he's digging.
And what of the messenger's message? The cables are intriguing, offering plenty of voyeuristic titillation but no gasp of
discovery. They provide texture but break little new ground. Yet their publication has done significant damage to the
courageous work of America's diplomats and may endanger lives. That's a tradeoff that I find troubling and unpersuasive."

Sarah Palin is wrong about John F. Kennedy, religion and
politics
By Kathleen Kennedy Townsend
Friday, December 3, 2010; 6:00 PM
Sarah Palin has found a new opponent to debate: John F. Kennedy.
In her new book, ""America by Heart,"" Palin objects to my uncle's famous 1960 speech to the Greater Houston Ministerial
Association, in which he challenged the ministers - and the country - to judge him, a Catholic presidential candidate, by
his views rather than his faith. ""Contrary to common newspaper usage, I am not the Catholic candidate for president,""
Kennedy said. ""I am the Democratic Party's candidate for president who happens also to be a Catholic.""
Palin writes that when she was growing up, she was taught that Kennedy's speech had ""succeeded in the best possible
way: It reconciled public service and religion without compromising either."" Now, however, she says she has revisited the
speech and changed her mind. She finds it ""defensive . . . in tone and content"" and is upset that Kennedy, rather than
presenting a reconciliation of his private faith and his public role, had instead offered an ""unequivocal divorce of the two.""
Palin's argument seems to challenge a great American tradition, enshrined in the Constitution, stipulating that there be no
religious test for public office. A careful reading of her book leads me to conclude that Palin wishes for precisely such a
test. And she seems to think that she, and those who think like her, are qualified to judge who would pass and who would
not.
If there is no religious test, then there is no need for a candidate's religious affiliation to be ""reconciled."" My uncle urged
that religion be private, removed from politics, because he feared that making faith an arena for public contention would
lead American politics into ill-disguised religious warfare, with candidates tempted to use faith to manipulate voters and
demean their opponents.
Kennedy cited Thomas Jefferson to argue that. as part of the American tradition, it was essential to keep any semblance
of a religious test out of the political realm. Best to judge candidates on their public records, their positions on war and
peace, jobs, poverty, and health care. No one, Kennedy pointed out, asked those who died at the Alamo which church
they belonged to.
But Palin insists on evaluating and acting as an authority on candidates' faith. She faults Kennedy for not ""telling the
country how his faith had enriched him."" With that line, she proceeds down a path fraught with danger - precisely the path
my uncle warned against when he said that a president's religious views should be ""neither imposed by him upon the
nation or imposed by the nation upon him as a condition to holding that office.""
After all, a candidate's faith will matter most to those who believe that they have the right to serve as arbiters of that faith.
Is it worthy? Is it deep? Is it reflected in a certain ideology?
Palin further criticizes Kennedy because, ""rather than spelling out how faith groups had provided life-changing services
and education to millions of Americans, he repeatedly objected to any government assistance to religious schools."" She
does not seem to appreciate that Kennedy was courageous in arguing that government funds should not be used in
parochial schools, despite the temptation to please his constituents. Many Catholics would have liked the money. But he
wisely thought that the use of public dollars in places where nuns explicitly proselytized would be unconstitutional. Tax
money should not be used to persuade someone to join a religion.
As a contrast to Kennedy's speech, Palin cites former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney's remarks during the 2008
Republican primary campaign, in which he spoke publicly of ""how my own faith would inform my presidency, if I were
elected."" After paying lip service to the separation of church and state, Romney condemned unnamed enemies ""intent on
establishing a new religion in America - the religion of secularism.""
""There is one fundamental question about which I am often asked,"" Romney said. ""What do I believe about Jesus Christ?""
Romney, of course, is a Mormon. He answered the question, proclaiming that ""Jesus Christ is the son of God.""
Palin praises Romney for delivering a ""thoughtful speech that eloquently and correctly described the role of faith in
American public life."" But if there should be no religious test in politics, then why should a candidate feel compelled to
respond to misplaced questions about his belief in Jesus?
When George Romney, Mitt Romney's father, was a presidential candidate in 1968, he felt no such compulsion. Respect
for the Constitution and the founders' belief in the separation of church and state suggests that those kinds of questions
should not play a role in political campaigns.
Palin contends that Kennedy sought to ""run away from religion."" The truth is that my uncle knew quite well that what made
America so special was its revolutionary assertion of freedom of religion. No nation on Earth had ever framed in law that
faith should be of no interest to government officials. For centuries, European authorities had murdered and tortured those
whose religious beliefs differed from their own.
To demand that citizens display their religious beliefs attacks the very foundation of our nation and undermines the
precise reason that America is exceptional.
Palin's book makes clear just how dangerous her proposed path can be. Not only does she want people to reveal their
beliefs, but she wants to sit in judgment of them if their views don't match her own. For instance, she criticizes Rep. Nancy
Pelosi (Calif.), a Democrat and a faithful Catholic, for ""talking the (God) talk but not walking the walk.""
Who is Palin to say what God's ""walk"" is? Who anointed her our grand inquisitor?
This is a woman who also praises Abraham Lincoln's Second Inaugural, even though Lincoln explicitly declared, ""But let
us judge not that we not be judged."" The problem for those setting up a free-floating tribunal to evaluate faith is that,
contrary to Lincoln, they are installing themselves as judges who can look into others' souls and assess their worthiness.
Kennedy did not and would not do that, but not because he was indifferent to faith. In fact, unlike Romney or Palin, in
fealty to both his faith and the Constitution, he promised on that day in Houston that he would resign if his religion ever
interfered with his duty as president.
My uncle was a man who had his faith tested. His brother and brother-in-law were killed in World War II, and his sister
died in a plane crash soon after the war. He suffered from painful injuries inflicted during his Navy service when his PT
boat was cut in two by a Japanese destroyer. His God did not make life easy but did require a commitment to justice.
America's first and oniy Catholic president referred to God three times in p_;.-:
.:1,rai.adc'res and invoked the Bible's
command to care for poor and the sick. Later in his presidency, 1.-.a ur;:•:-.1uvocaliv. about riohi:s: We are
confronted primarily with a moral issue. It is as old as the Scriptures and is as clear as the American Constitution.""
Faith runs as a deep current through my family. Faith inspired my uncles' and my father's dedication to justice. My father,
Robert F. Kennedy, on returning from apartheid-era South Africa in 1966, wrote a magazine article titled ""Suppose God Is -
Black."" And my uncle Teddy fought for health care for all Americans, even if in her book }Dalin presumes to judge that he
took positions ""directly at odds with his Catholic faith.""
Teddy Kennedy believed that his stands were at one with his faith. He did disagree with the Roman Catholic hierarchy at
times. But as we have seen, the hierarchy's positions can change, and in our church, we have an obligation to help bring
about those changes. That may not be Palin's theology, but the glory of America is its support for those who would
disagree - even on the most difficult and personal matters, such as religion.
John F. Kennedy knew that tearing down the wall separating church and state would tempt us toward self-righteousness
and contempt for others. That is one reason he delivered his Houston speech.
Palin, for her part, argues that ""morality itself cannot be sustained without the support of religious beliefs."" That statement
amounts to a wholesale attack on countless Americans, and no study or reasonable argument I have seen or heard would
support such a blanket condemnation. For a person who claims to admire Lincoln, Palin curiously ignores his injunction
that Americans, even those engaged in a Civil War, show ""malice toward none, with charity for ail.""
Pal in fails to understand the genius of our nation. The United States is one of the most vibrant religious countries on Earth
precisely because of its religious freedom. When power and faith are entwined, faith loses. Power tends to obfuscate,
corrupt and focus on temporal rather than eternal purposes.
Somehow Palin misses this. Perhaps she didn't read the full Houston speech; she certainly doesn't know it by heart. Or
she may be appealing to a religious right that really seeks secular power. I don't know.
I am certain, however, that no American political leader should cavalierly - or out of political calculation - dismiss the hard-
won ideal of religious freedom that is among our country's greatest gifts to the world. As John F. Kennedy said in Houston,
that is the ""kind of America I believe in.""

WASHINGTON—In the first major policy fallout from the WikiLeaks disclosures, the State Department has ordered all
U.S. diplomats to ""cease and desist telling the truth until further notice.""
""We are working overtime to fly to make sure that leaks like these don't happen again,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
told reporters. ""But until we've got the leaks plugged, it's incumbent on all our diplomats to put on their lying caps.""
Clinton noted that since many U.S. diplomats are major political donors with long careers in the business world, ""this
shouldn't be a reach for them."" But for those career diplomats who came up through the Foreign Service, the State
Department will be holding a series of ""truth avoidance seminars,"" led by executives of Goldman Sachs.
Additionally, Clinton said, the State Department would install on all diplomats' computers new software called
CandorShield', which automatically translates truthful language into a less embarrassing truth-free version. For
example, she explained, the software would translate the phrase ""two-faced weasels"" into ""trusted Pakistani allies"" and
would delete all references to French President Nicolas Sarkozy as ""Monsieur Shorty Pants.""

New Start: Ratify, With Caveats
The treaty helpfully reinstates on-site verification of Russian nuclear forces, but senators should make it clear to
Moscow that they don't see it as limiting U.S. missile defenses.
By CONDOLEEZZA RICE
When U.S. President Bush and Russian President Putin signed the Moscow Treaty in 2002, they addressed the nuclear
threat by reducing offensive weapons,-as their predecessors had. But the Moscow Treaty was different. It came in the
wake of America's 2001 withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, and for the first time the United States
and Russia reduced their offensive nuclear weapons with no agreement in place that constrained missile defenses.
Breaking the link between offensive force reductions and limits on defense marked a key moment in the establishment
of a new nuclear agenda no longer focused on the Cold War face-off between the Warsaw Pact and NATO. The real
threat was that the world's most dangerous weapons could end up in the hands of the world's most dangerous
regimes—or of terrorists who would launch attacks more devastating than 9/11. And since those very rogue states also
pursued ballistic missiles, defenses would (alongside offensive weapons) be integral to the security of the United States
and our allies.
It is in this context that we should consider the potential contribution of the New Start treaty to U.S. national security.
The treaty is modest, reducing offensive nuclear weapons to 1,550 on each side—more than enough for deterrence.
While the treaty puts limits on launchers, U.S. military commanders have testified that we will be able to maintain a
triad of bombers, submarine-based delivery vehicles and land-based delivery vehicles. Moreover, the treaty helpfully
reinstates on-site verification of Russian nuclear forces, which lapsed with the expiration of the original Start treaty last
year.
Meaningful verification was a significant achievement of Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush, and its
reinstatement is crucial.
Still, there are legitimate concerns about New Start that must and can be addressed in the ratification process and, if the
treaty is ratified, in future monitoring of the Obama administration's commitments.
First, smaller forces make the modernization of our nuclear infrastructure even more urgent. Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona has
led a valiant effort in this regard. Thanks to his efforts, roughly $84 billion is being allocated to the Department of
Energy's nuclear weapons complex. Ratifying the treaty will help cement these commitments, and Congress should fully
fund the president's program.
Congress should also support the Defense Department in modernizing our launchers as suggested in the recent defense
strategy study coauthored by former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry and former National Security Adviser Stephen
Hadley.
Second, the Senate must make absolutely clear that in ratifying this treaty, the U.S. is not re-establishing the Cold War
link between offensive forces and missile defenses. New Start's preamble is worrying in this regard, as it recognizes the
""interrelationship"" of the two. Administration officials have testified that there is no link, and that the treaty will not
limit U.S. missile defenses. But Congress should ensure that future Defense Department budgets reflect this.
Moscow contends that only current U.S. missile-defense plans are acceptable under the treaty. But the U.S. must remain
fully free to explore and then deploy the best defenses—not just those imagined today. That includes pursuing both
potential qualitative breakthroughs and quantitative increases.
I have personally witnessed Moscow's tendency to interpret every utterance as a binding commitment. The Russians
need to understand that the U.S. will use the full-range of American technology and talent to improve our ability to
intercept and destroy the ballistic missiles of hostile countries.
Russia should be reassured by the fact that its nuclear arsenal is far too sophisticated and large to be degraded by our
missile defenses. In addition, the welcome agreements on missile-defense cooperation reached in Lisbon recently
between NATO and Russia can improve transparency and allow Moscow and Washington to work together in this field.
After all, a North Korean or Iranian missile is not a threat only to the United States, but to international stability broadly.
Ratification of the treaty also should not be sold as a way to buy Moscow's cooperation on other issues. The men in the
Kremlin know that loose nukes in the hands of terrorists—some who operate in Russia's unstable south—are dangerous.
That alone should give our governments a reason to work together beyond New Start and address the threat from
tactical nuclear weapons, which are smaller and more dispersed, and therefore harder to monitor and control. Russia
knows too that a nuclear Iran in the volatile Middle East or the further development of North Korea's arsenal is not in its
interest. Russia lives in those neighborhoods. That helps explain Moscow's toughening stance toward Tehran and its
longstanding concern about Pyongyang.
The issue before the Senate is the place of New Start in America's future security. Nuclear weapons will be with us for a
long time.
After this treaty, our focus must be on stopping dangerous proliferators—not on further reductions in the U.S. and
Russian strategic arsenals, which are really no threat to each other or to international stability.
A modern but smaller nuclear arsenal and increasingly sophisticated defenses are the right bases for U.S. nuclear
security (and that of our allies) going forward. With the right commitments and understandings, ratification of the New
Start treaty can contribute to this goal. If the Senate enters those commitments and understandings into the record of
ratification, New Start deserves bipartisan support, whether in the lame-duck session or next year.
Ms. Rice, a professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a senior fellow at Stanford's
Hoover Institution, was U.S. national security adviser from 2001 to 2005 and U.S. secretary of state from 2005 to 2009."

G.O.P. Support for Arms Treaty
By
PETER BAKER
Another Republican senator signaled Tuesday that he may vote for the new arms control treaty with Russia if it comes
up for a vote before the Senate adjourns for the year later this month.
Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who did not run for re-election, said he hopes that the Senate will get a chance
to vote on the treaty, known as New Start, right after a deal on tax cuts and a spending resolution to keep the
government operating.
""Start is an important issue. It should be fully debated. I am leaning towards supporting it,"" he told Andrea Mitchell on
MSNBC. ""I haven't made a final decision,"" he added, noting that Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the lead Republican
negotiator on the treaty, still has concerns. ""He has some reservations, but I believe many of those reservations are
being addressed,"" Mr. Gregg said.
President Obama has made passing the treaty his top foreign policy priority for the lame-duck session. Under the
Constitution, approving a treaty requires a two-thirds super-majority, or 67 votes, meaning that Mr. Obama needs nine
Republicans assuming all 58 Democrats stick with him.
At this point, more than that many Republicans have offered positive-sounding statements like that made on Tuesday"

In the Bitter New Washington
December 23, 2010
•
;izaibeth O w
Of course Obama should have gotten out of Washington more and listened to people, not just talked at them; and, as
Walter Mondale said recently, he should have gotten rid of ""those idiot boards""—the TelePrompters on which the great
orator has been strangely dependent and which divide him from his audiences. Last year, a friend of mine was invited to a
Hanukkah party that the Obamas gave for prominent Jews (a group with whom there had been tensions), and after the
Obamas descended the grand stairway, they stood in the foyer briefly; the President made a few remarks and shook a
few hands, and back up the stairs they went. No mingling.
In their first two years, the Obamas have seemed a bit tone-deaf: there were too many vacations while people were
hurting, especially Michelle's extravagant trip to Spain. (I'm as interested in Michelle's clothes as the next woman but at
the same time think she and her staff are too focused on her looking smashing, which she does. Her wardrobe seems
quite extensive for these troubled times.)
Barack Obama's personality has been much mulled over in the past two years, but it seems inescapable that his high self-
esteem often slides over the thin line to arrogance, which trickles down (with some exceptions) to much of his staff, some
of whom are downright rude to all but a chosen few. °barna has seemed uninterested in anyone but his immediate group,
and three of the four members of his immediate circle--Jarrett, Robert Gibbs, David Axelrod—had had no experience in
governing. The fourth, Rahm Emanuel, expressed himself with such flippancy, arrogance, and overuse of the F-word that
he offended not just members of Congress but also would-be allies of the President.
Vice President Joe Bider), who is liked on Capitol Hill, was virtually shut out of the dealings with people in Congress in the
first two years—""I can handle them,"" Obama told Biden—but Biden is now expected to be given a larger role as part of the
White House's new determination to ""reach out."" (A few months ago highly placed members of the staff also swore they
would ""reach out,"" but that seemed to last for just a few days.) One of the oddest aspects of Obama's persona is that
someone who seems so confident has insisted thus far in having people around him with whom he is said to be
""comfortable.""
For example, Torn Donilon, his recently appointed national security adviser (a promotion from his role as deputy), is by all
accounts a capable man but is no one's idea of a serious strategic thinker. The explanation I was given for Donilon's
being given his new position was that ""the President is comfortable with him."" Just as Obama is described as pleased with
himself, he has been treated with hero worship by much of his staff. After all, he had taken on the formidable Clintons,
and, against the expectation of almost all the pundits and the experts, he had beaten them. Why should he listen to those
who had doubted him? A common complaint about the Obama White House in the first two years has been that there
were no ""grown-ups"" around, people who knew more about governing and who would tell Obama that he was wrong.
When people tried to suggest someone who should be brought in, that person was rejected as ""not one of ours."" Joe
Biden is said to argue with Obama on issues, such as Afghanistan, but not to get into the management of the White
House....
Those who supported Obama in 2008 expected him to be able to move public opinion, to get people to follow him. The
fact that the Obama White House has been so poor at ""messaging"" baffles even his strongest supporters. In fact, he had
no overall message. As Winston Churchill put it, there was no theme to his pudding. When I asked a White House aide
about this, he pointed to what had been billed as a ""major speech on the economy,"" at Georgetown University in April
2009. But the speech was utterly forgettable—and forgotten. One ally attributes this problem to the inexperience of both
Obama and his top staff. An ally says, ""You can't leave a message if you don't have a strategy and you don't know where
you're going."" Another says, ""They had something that worked in the campaign but didn't work in the White House.""
Thus, Obama didn't see the need to explain what he was doing. His 2010 campaign themes seemed to wander all over
the place: Stanley Greenberg, a pollster and former aide to Bill Clinton, said that Obama's oft-used theme, that we
shouldn't go back to the Bush days, actually tested negatively, because people didn't believe that the country was making
economic, progress.
So Obama's biggest failure was not to be the leader that so many expected him to be. The jubilation that surrounded his
swearing-in may have gone to his head, while the celebrants overlooked that there were plenty of people out there who
were not overjoyed at the advent of a black president, or even a Democrat. Obama was, apparently in his own estimation,
so smart and so adored that he seems to have felt no need to explain—and explain again—to the country what he was
doing and to take the country along with him. This failure to put his programs across came up a few times in the 2010
campaign....
More than once, people in town hall meetings told him that they were behind him but were having great trouble trying to
defend or explain his agenda. In a backyard gathering on October 21 he made the most awkward reply of those I heard:
""Our attitude was that we just had to get the policies right and we didn't always think about making sure we got the
advertising properly about what was going on."" Advertising. (When I mentioned this to a Democratic senator who was
generally supportive of Obama, this ordinarily polite man responded, ""Bullocks! What policies?"")
The risk-averse Obama had left it to Congress to write the big bills such as on the economic stimulus and health care
(with strong participation by White House aides). But he kept up this line of defense all the way through to his pathetic
press conference on the day after the election. In these comments, Obama gave away the devastating fact that he didn't
really understand the role of the president as leader. A friend of the Obama administration said to me, ""Their definition of
governing is passing bills."" Someone else relatively close to the White House explained that since Obama had been so
criticized for being ""arrogant"" and ""aloof,"" he had to eat large portions of humble pie. (""And I take responsibility for that,""
Obama said again and again.)"

December 10, 2010
WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Olympia). Snowe (R-Maine) released the following statement in support of Senate
ratification of the New START Treaty:
""The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as New START, was signed by the United States and Russia on April
8th and transmitted for the advice and consent of the Senate on May 13th of this year. Since then, the U.S. Senate has
held 18 hearings and as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I have worked with my colleagues to
scrutinize this agreement and ensure any classified matters are properly vetted. Much has changed since the original
START was first negotiated in 1991, and as a result I have supported efforts to make certain that questions regarding our
ability to verify Russian compliance with the Treaty's limits, to develop and deploy effective missile defenses, and to
modernize our nuclear weapons complex, have been satisfactorily resolved.
""I am confident that New START will provide predictability in our relationship with Russia and thus enhance global
stability, and most importantly, our national security. Therefore, if the Majority moves to consider New START under a
framework that allows for sufficient debate and amendments, I intend to support the Resolution of Advice and Consent."""

The Cancun Agreements
Over the last year, the United States has worked with our international partners to build on the progress achieved at the
climate change conference in Copenhagen. We have pressed for substantive steps that would advance the vision of the
Copenhagen Accord. This month we joined the nations of the world in Cancun for a new round of talks aimed at
mobilizing common action to meet the shared global challenge of climate change.
Today I am pleased to announce that we secured the Cancun Agreements, a set of balanced international decisions
under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) which represent meaningful progress in
our global response to climate change.
These agreements advance each of the core elements of the Copenhagen Accord: They anchor the Accord's mitigation
pledges; build on a system of transparency with substantial detail and content of International Consultations and
Analysis which will provide confidence that a country's pledges are being carried out; launch a new Green Climate Fund;
create a framework to reduce deforestation in developing countries; establish a technology mechanism; and Setup a
framework and committee to will promote international cooperation and action on adaptation.
The Cancun Agreements represent a balanced and significant step forward. In the days and months ahead, the United
States will work with our friends and partners to keep the world focused on this urgent challenge and to continue
building on this progress.

that new START will then be the next order of business. But that hasn't been decided yet. They could turn to the

loomberg to Publish Editorials
By ,IERE-:EviY PE.TEP.S
Being mayor of New York City would be a large enough platform for just about anyone. But apparently not for Michael R.
The mayor's company, 3loomber,
,3 L.P., said on Wednesday that it would begin publishing editorials across its vast media
enterprise in an effort to broaden the company's influence on national affairs. And though Mr. Bloomberg has an
agreement with the city to have no involvement in the ""day-to-day operations"" of his company, the endeavor, called
Bloomberg View, is intended to channel his personal philosophy and worldview.
""I think it's very important that everyone understands that our editorial page is going to be, for sure, consistent with the
values and beliefs of the founder — even if he happens to be mayor of New York City,"" said Matthew Winkler, the editor in
chief of Bloomberg News. ""I fully expect us in our Bloomberg View always to reflect those values. In fact, I want people to
come away from reading the Bloomberg View infused with those beliefs and values.""
The effort presents a host of conflict-of-interest questions for the mayor. The new venture provides the mayor with yet
another potent communications apparatus — one that carries his name and imprimatur — to sound off on issues that
collide with his job as mayor, his corporate interests and his expanding philanthropic empire.
Bloomberg L.P. executives said they would not shy away from publishing editorials on issues in which Mr. Bloomberg has
a direct interest as mayor, like education, public health and environmental policy. Mr. Winkler said the editorials would not
avoid such issues but would disclose the mayor's involvement when warranted.
Though Mr. Bloomberg will not have a hand in conceiving and writing the editorials, he is likely to offer feedback from time
to time before they are published, Mr. Winkler said.
""I think that there's a very good chance that's going to happen,"" he said, referring to Mr. Bloomberg's occasional
involvement. It is unclear whether that level of involvement is permitted under his agreement with the city to remain at
arm's length from the company.
A spokesman for the mayor, Stu Loeser, said the mayor was allowed limited involvement in his agreement with the city.
""Weighing in from time to time is consistent with his being the majority shareholder of the company he founded,"" he said.
As someone whose presidential ambitions are the source of endless speculation, acquiring the platform of an editorial
page is certain to draw more attention to Mr. Bloomberg's plans. (On Sunday, Mr. Bloomberg ruled out a run for
president.)
The unsigned editorials will appear in all of Bloomberg's online and print media properties — including Bloomberg
Businessweek, Bloomberg.com and the nearly 300,000 financial data terminals leased to Wall Street traders and
businesses around the world. It will be run by two distinguished voices: James P. Rubin, a former assistant secretary of
state under Bill Clinton, and David Shipley, editor of The New York Times Op-Ed page.
Opinion and commentary have not typically been areas of focus for Bloomberg, with its just-the-facts approach. In fact,
the mayor has complained about the corrosive effect of the 24-hour news cycle and overheated political commentary in
the blogosphere.
But company leaders, including Mr. Bloomberg, who has been aware of the project since it was conceived more than two
years ago, saw an opportunity to extend their influence.
For a firm that has made no secret of its ambitions to become the most influential media company in the world, starting an
editorial operation is the latest effort to propel it beyond its core mission as a financial news service.
The notion of media barons using editorials to shape public opinion and policy according to their personal views is an old
one in American journalism. William Randolph Hearst, for example, often wrote front-page editorials for his newspapers.
Mr. Bloomberg, it would seem, is casting himself in that mold, though there are no plans for him to begin writing signed
editorials. For now, he is content letting his trusted deputies speak for him.
""He's accepting and embracing the privilege of a media mogul,"" said David Nasaw, a professor of history at the City
University of New York Graduate Center, who wrote a biography of Hearst. ""This is what we all do. We try to persuade the
rest of the world we are right. Of course we don't have the vehicles to do so. The rich have the vehicles to do so.""
Mr. Winkler said: ""There's a huge opportunity here for Bloomberg L.P. and Bloomberg News to seize the day, literally
seize the day by bringing wisdom to events as they unfold. And one can't always do that with the best result with
reporting.""
""That certainly is a benefit to the founder of the company, the man. But it is also a huge opportunity for Bloomberg, the
company, that it should take advantage of,"" Mr. Winkler added.
Bloomberg L.P. acquired BusinessWeek last year, giving the 29-year-old company a print product with a long legacy of
accomplishment.
Bloomberg is in the midst of an expansion in Washington. With a service called Bloomberg Government, an operation that
will eventually employ 300 journalists and analysts, the company will sell, for $5,700 a year, information about government
services and contracts to lobbyists and others with business interests in the nation's capital."

The Envoy
Posted by Hendrik Hertzberg
Last night, as I was unlocking my bike on a windswept Greenwich Village sidewalk after leaving a holiday party, a friend
approached, cell phone in hand. A few minutes earlier, she and I had been inside, chatting happily amid the buzz and warmth of
a holiday party. Now she had tears in her eyes. ""Richard Holbrooke died,"" she said.
Notwithstanding the hospital bulletins since he fell ill on Saturday—critical condition, damaged aorta, emergency surgery—this
sudden, awful ending was a shock, because Richard Holbrooke was such an astounding volcano of vitality. Everything about
him was large: his physical size, including the ultimate ""in your face"" face, a face like a Times Square billboard; his buzz-saw
voice, a highly expressive instrument, equally adept at piano (a side-of-the-mouth, gossipy wisecrack, often pleasingly nasty)
and forte (a high-decibel outburst of anger or indignation, almost always calculated for effect); his appetites (for experience, for
danger, for praise, for power, for fun); and his ambitions (for himself, for his beliefs, for the United States, for the world). He
was no doe-eyed peacenik, but as a diplomat he labored long and hard to seek alternatives to war and ways to end particular
wars. He was sentimental about his own unsentimentality, romantic about his own tough-guy realism.
Unlike my tearful informant, who had known Holbrooke as a family friend since she was a little girl, I was acquainted with him
in the casual way of many journalists and editors. He was a peer as well as a ""source,"" a prolific and forceful writer whose
favorite venues, The New Republic and The New Yorker, happened to be the places where I've spent my working life. He was
gregarious and fond of big, splashy black-tie evenings. The last time I saw him was six weeks ago, on November 1st, at the
New York Public Library's ""Literary Lions"" celebration. At the pre-dinner reception, where he would normally have been on
his feet, looming large, he repaired to a folding chair behind a little table and let his wife, Kati Marton, bring the party to him.
At sixty-nine he was tired—that much was obvious—but he was as sharp and voluble as ever. He still had plenty to do.
Not long after Holbrooke achieved his greatest diplomatic triumph by negotiating the 1995 end to the Balkan wars, I asked him
if he liked Warren Zevon's wonderful song ""The Envoy."" He said he'd never heard of it. The next day I sent him a CD. After
that, he mentioned it every single time I've seen him, up to and including that NYPL gala, saying he puts it on, loud, when he
needs a lift. And no wonder: his life was a drama, and he liked it that way.
If the Supreme Court had allowed the votes to be counted in 2000, then the Envoy, almost certainly, would have become the
Secretary of State, and the next decade would have unfolded very differently. As it is, Holbrooke has left a stronger, more
positive, more creative mark on history than all but a few of those who have held that post. He certainly did not die of a broken
heart—Kati Marton saw to that—but it was surely the ghastly, impossible demands of his last, impossible assignment that
brought on the rending of his aorta. He died for his country as surely as any soldier. And his deathbed words may turn out to be
the most important he ever spoke.

7938,"Hi. Sorry I haven't had a chance to see you, but I did want you to hear directly from me that it was a great result in
Cancun. Way beyond any expectations. Many challenges ahead, but a very good day for us and a great day for Mexico.
Have a very happy holiday if I don't see you before. Best, Todd"

I assume you saw this by now -- if not, it's worth a read.
Forwarded message"
7941,"Big change of plans in the Senate. Senator Reid just announced that he was no longer going to move forward with the
omnibus appropriations bill. Instead, he filed cloture motions on the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell and the DREAM
Act.
Those petitions will ripen on Saturday. So it looks like the Senate will be again considering the new START Treaty
tomorrow. We should know the starting time shortly."
